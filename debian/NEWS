smokeping (2.3.5-1) unstable; urgency=low

  The configuration file, /etc/smokeping/config, has been split into
  subsection snippets in /etc/smokeping/config.d to ease merging of
  configuration changes. The installation scripts will automatically 
  split the old configuration on upgrades, but the split won't take
  effect unless dpkg is allowed to overwrite /etc/smokeping/config.
  .
  This version also includes packaging changes to make the new
  master/slave functionality work. A new directory, /var/lib/smokeping/__cgi,
  has been created so that the CGI on a master host can queue up
  ping results received from its slaves. The main Smokeping daemon
  will then monitor the queue and update the RRD files accordingly.
  .
  Make sure to accept or merge manually the new 'dyndir' and
  'precreateperms' General section variables on upgrades, otherwise the
  master/slave functionality (and most probably also the old DYNAMIC
  host functionality) will not work.

smokeping (2.0.8-3) unstable; urgency=low

  When upgrading from Smokeping versions 1.x to 2.x, you may have to edit
  the configuration file /etc/smokeping/config. The most common incompatibility
  is that the 'PROBE_CONF' lines are neither needed nor accepted anymore. Simply
  deleting these lines is sufficient.
 
  There are some other small incompatibilities; a list of those can be found
  in the smokeping_upgrade(7) document. As the Smokeping configuration file
  parser is now much more strict than in 1.x, the daemon complains about
  these at startup and refuses to start.

  (This entry applies to all Smokeping 2.x versions, but was only added in
  version 2.0.8-3.)
