smokeping (2.3.6-4) unstable; urgency=low

  The file hierarchy available to the web server has been moved
  away from /var/www, which was a non-standard location. The recommended 
  way to set up the web part of Smokeping is to use the Apache2 configuration
  supplied in /etc/smokeping/apache2.conf. See the README.Debian file.
  .
  Although the upgrade procedure tries to keep old setups working
  with symlinks, make sure to merge the pathname changes in
  /etc/smokeping/config.d/pathnames. Deleting /var/www/smokeping
  afterwards should be safe if you have no manually added content there.
  .
  The recommended URL path to the CGI script is now /smokeping/smokeping.cgi
  rather than /cgi-bin/smokeping.cgi. The latter is now just a symlink,
  which will be removed after the next stable release ("squeeze").

  The default character set in /etc/smokeping/config.d/Presentation has
  been changed to UTF-8. If you were relying on the former ISO-8859-15
  setting, just edit the file to reflect this.

smokeping (2.3.5-1) experimental; urgency=low

  The configuration file, /etc/smokeping/config, has been split into
  subsection snippets in /etc/smokeping/config.d to ease merging of
  configuration changes. The installation scripts will automatically 
  split the old configuration on upgrades, but the split won't take
  effect unless ucf is allowed to overwrite /etc/smokeping/config.
  .
  This version also includes packaging changes to make the new
  master/slave functionality work. A new directory, /var/lib/smokeping/__cgi,
  has been created so that the CGI on a master host can queue up
  ping results received from its slaves. The main Smokeping daemon
  will then monitor the queue and update the RRD files accordingly.
  .
  Make sure to merge the new 'dyndir' and 'precreateperms' General section
  variables on upgrades, otherwise the master/slave functionality (and
  most probably also the old DYNAMIC host functionality) will not work.

smokeping (2.0.8-3) unstable; urgency=low

  When upgrading from Smokeping versions 1.x to 2.x, you may have to edit
  the configuration file /etc/smokeping/config. The most common incompatibility
  is that the 'PROBE_CONF' lines are neither needed nor accepted anymore. Simply
  deleting these lines is sufficient.
 
  There are some other small incompatibilities; a list of those can be found
  in the smokeping_upgrade(7) document. As the Smokeping configuration file
  parser is now much more strict than in 1.x, the daemon complains about
  these at startup and refuses to start.

  (This entry applies to all Smokeping 2.x versions, but was only added in
  version 2.0.8-3.)
