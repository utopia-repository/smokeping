smokeping (2.0.8-3) unstable; urgency=low

  When upgrading from Smokeping versions 1.x to 2.x, you may have to edit
  the configuration file /etc/smokeping/config. The most common incompatibility
  is that the 'PROBE_CONF' lines are neither needed nor accepted anymore. Simply
  deleting these lines is sufficient.
 
  There are some other small incompatibilities; a list of those can be found
  in the smokeping_upgrade(7) document. As the Smokeping configuration file
  parser is now much more strict than in 1.x, the daemon complains about
  these at startup and refuses to start.

  (This entry applies to all Smokeping 2.x versions, but was only added in
  version 2.0.8-3.)
