  After installing the package you have to edit the file 
 /etc/smokeping/config to set your preferences. You can follow
 the example provided. 
 Note that the domain names are bogus to avoid all the people 
 who install the package DoSing the same servers, but at the same time
 an fping probe in localhost is enabled, so you can check if smokeping
 works for you.

  You can also edit the file /etc/smokeping/basepage.html to suit 
 your needs.

  Anyway, please refer to the smokeping_config man page to see
 all the available options.

The web server configuration is done automatically on new installations
when possible. If that doesn't happen, the recommended way to get the
CGI script working is 

 ln -s /etc/smokeping/apache2.conf /etc/apache2/conf.d/smokeping
 invoke-rc.d apache2 restart

See NEWS.Debian for information on upgrades from older versions of
the package.

If you have problems getting the CGI to reload your configuration
file after changes, you may have to kill lingering speedy_backend
processes. See #397609. This should not happen, but I haven't found
the bug yet. If you have a reproducible way to trigger this, 
please send me your configuration files before and after the change.
