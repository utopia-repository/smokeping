  After installing the package you have to edit the file 
 /etc/smokeping/config to set your preferences. You can follow
 the example provided (note that the domain names are bogus to 
 avoid all the people who install the package DoSing the same 
 servers).

  You can also edit the file /etc/smokeping/basepage.html to suit 
 your needs.

  Anyway, please refer to the smokeping_config man page to see
 all the available options.
