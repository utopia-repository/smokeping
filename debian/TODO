This package is being rebuilt with latest packaging tricks (dh7 and
quilt) and with the latest upstream versions. Things may not work at
all right now.

The following issues need to be fixed:

* this needs testing! no way this really works now
* fast-cgi should be default
* cgi should be in /usr/lib/cgi-bin/smokeping.cgi
* docbase is screwed up, docs is all man now?
* lots of .dist files are installed, install real configs by default:
- usr/share/smokeping/smokeping.fcgi.dist
* remove extra files:
-       rm -f $(TMP)/usr/share/smokeping/lib/BER.pm
-       rm -f $(TMP)/usr/share/smokeping/lib/SNMP_*
* review upstream changes since last release, esp. config changes

A lot of the above was taken care of by the old rules file, reuse
that.
