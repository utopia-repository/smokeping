The following issues need to be fixed:

* fast-cgi should be default
* review upstream changes since last release, esp. config changes
* do not prompt for modifications on the files:
- Slaves
- General
- basepage.html
-> apparently if we have a .dpkg-orig file next to those, based on the
   proper conffiles in 2.3.6, dpkg will be happy.
