The following issues need to be fixed:

* fast-cgi should be default
* review upstream changes since last release, esp. config changes
* do not prompt for modifications on the files:
- Slaves
- General
- basepage.html
 - this is very hard. we would need to fix the checksum in
   /var/lib/dpkg/status, which doesn't seem to be doable
   programmatically. See dpkg/src/configure.c:336 to see how this
   works better.
