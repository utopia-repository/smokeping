This package is being rebuilt with latest packaging tricks (dh7 and
quilt) and with the latest upstream versions. Things may not work at
all right now.

The following issues need to be fixed:

* upgrades need to be tested
* fast-cgi should be default
* review upstream changes since last release, esp. config changes

A lot of the above was taken care of by the old rules file, reuse
that.
