Description: latency logging and graphing system
 SmokePing consists of a daemon process which organizes the 
 latency measurements and a CGI which presents the graphs. 
 .
 With SmokePing you can measure latency and packet loss in your network. 
 SmokePing uses RRDtool to maintain a longterm datastore and to draw pretty
 graphs giving up to the minute information on the state of each 
 network connection.
