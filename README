   SmokePing is a latency logging and graphing
   system. It consists of a daemon process which
   organizes the latency measurements and a CGI which
   presents the graphs.


SmokePing is ...
================

 * quite fast because it uses FPing todo the actual pinging

 * easy to customize through a webtemplate and an extensive
   configuration file.

 * written in perl and should readily port to any unix system

 * extensible through plug-in modules

 * an RRDtool frontend

 * able to deal with DYNAMIC IP addresses as used with
   Cable and ADSL internet.

Roadmap
=======

SmokePing comes with documentation to make it easy to use and
install. The following important documentation files are
included with SmokePing:


 * doc/smokeping_install.txt -- How to Setup and Install 
 * doc/smokeping_config.txt  -- Description of the Config File
 * doc/smokeping.txt         -- About the SmokePing Daemon   
 * doc/smokeping.cgi.txt     -- About the CGI Module

In the doc directory you can find even more information
and the above documents in MAN, POD, TXT and HTML format.

Do you like it
==============

If you like SmokePing, and want to show your appreciation for
the work I am doing (SmokePing like MRTG and RRDtool have
been written entirely in my spare time) please feel free to
