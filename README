   SmokePing is a latency logging and graphing and
   alerting system. It consists of a daemon process which
   organizes the latency measurements and a CGI which
   presents the graphs.


SmokePing is ...
================

 * extensible through plug-in modules

 * easy to customize through a webtemplate and an extensive
   configuration file.

 * written in perl and should readily port to any unix system

 * an RRDtool frontend

 * able to deal with DYNAMIC IP addresses as used with
   Cable and ADSL internet.

If you like SmokePing, and want to show your appreciation for
the work I am doing (SmokePing like MRTG and RRDtool have
been written entirely in my spare time) please feel free to
