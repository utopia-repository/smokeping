SmokePing takes its configuration from a single central configuration file.
Its location must be hardcoded in the smokeping script and smokeping.cgi.
.PP
The contents of this manual is generated directly from the configuration
file parser.
.PP
The Parser for the Configuration file is written using David Schweikers
ParseConfig module. Read all about it in the ISG::ParseConfig manpage.
.PP
The Configuration file has a tree-like structure with section headings at
various levels. It also contains variable assignements and tables.

.IX Item "cgiurl (mandatory setting)"
Complete \s-1URL\s0 path of the SmokePing.cgi
.Ip "\fBmailhost\fR" 4

counter and homepage. I would be glad if you would not remove this as
it gives me an indication as to how widely used the tool is.
.Ip "\fBcharset\fR" 4
.IX Item "charset"
By default, SmokePing assumes the 'iso-8859\-15' character set. If you use
something else, this is the place to speak up.

The following sections are valid on level 2:
.RS 4
.RE
.Ip "\fB++loss_colors\fR" 4
.IX Item "++loss_colors"
In the Detail view, the color of the median line depends
the amount of lost packets. SmokePing comes with a reasonable default setting,
but you may choose to disagree. The table below
lets you specify your own coloring.
.Sp
Example:
.Sp
.Vb 4
\& Loss Color   Legend
\& 1    00ff00    "<1"

.IX Item "column 2"
Description for this range.
.RE
.RS 4
.RE
.Ip "\fB++uptime_colors\fR" 4
.IX Item "++uptime_colors"
When monitoring a host with \s-1DYNAMIC\s0 addressing, SmokePing will keep track of how long
the machine is able to keep the same \s-1IP\s0 address. This time is plotted as a color
in the graphs background. SmokePing comes with a reasonable default setting,
but you may choose to disagree. The table below
lets you specify your own coloring
.Sp
Example:
.Sp
.Vb 5
\& Uptime Color     Legend
\& 3600    00ff00   "<1h"
\& 86400   0000ff   "<1d"

.Sh "*** Probes *** \fI(mandatory section)\fP"
.IX Subsection "*** Probes *** (mandatory section)"
The Probes Section configures Probe modules. Probe modules integrate an external ping command into SmokePing. Check the documentation of the Ping module for configuration details.
.PP
The following sections are valid on level 1:
.Ip "\fB+/[\-_0\-9a-zA-Z]+/\fR" 4
.IX Item "+/[-_0-9a-zA-Z]+/"
Each module can take specific configuration information from this area. The jumble of letters above is a regular expression defining legal module names.
.Sp
The following variables can be set in this section:
.RS 4
.Ip "\fB/[\-_0\-9a-zA-Z]+/\fR" 4
.IX Item "/[-_0-9a-zA-Z]+/"
Each module defines which
variables it wants to accept. So this expression here just defines legal variable names.
.RE

.RE
.Sh "*** Targets *** \fI(mandatory section)\fP"
.IX Subsection "*** Targets *** (mandatory section)"
The Target Section defines the actual work of SmokePing. It contains a hierarchical list
of hosts which mark the endpoints of the network connections the system should monitor.
Each section can contain one host as well as other sections.
.PP
The following variables can be set in this section:
.Ip "\fBprobe\fR \fI(mandatory setting)\fR" 4
.IX Item "probe (mandatory setting)"
The name of the probe module to be used for this host. The value of
this variable gets propagated
.Ip "\fBmenu\fR \fI(mandatory setting)\fR" 4
.IX Item "menu (mandatory setting)"
Menu entry for this section
.Ip "\fBtitle\fR \fI(mandatory setting)\fR" 4
.IX Item "title (mandatory setting)"

described above. The expression above defines legal names for target
sections.

.PD
Some information about this entry which does \s-1NOT\s0 get displayed on the web.
.Ip "\fBemail\fR" 4
.IX Item "email"
This is the contact address for the owner of the current host. In connection with the \fB\s-1DYNAMIC\s0\fR hosts,
the address will be used for sending the belowmentioned script.
.Ip "\fBhost\fR" 4
.IX Item "host"
Can either contain the name of a target host or the string \fB\s-1DYNAMIC\s0\fR.
.Sp
In the second case, the target machine has a dynamic \s-1IP\s0 address and
thus is required to regularly contact the SmokePing server to verify
its \s-1IP\s0 address.  When starting SmokePing with the commandline argument
\&\fB\*(--email\fR it will add a secret password to each of the \fB\s-1DYNAMIC\s0\fR
host lines and send a script to the owner of each host. This script
must be started regularly on the host in question to make sure
SmokePing monitors the right box. If the target machine supports
\&\s-1SNMP\s0 SmokePing will also query the hosts
sysContact, sysName and sysLocation properties to make sure it is
still the same host.
