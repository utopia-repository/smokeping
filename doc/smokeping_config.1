.IX Title "SMOKEPING_CONFIG 1"
.TH SMOKEPING_CONFIG 1 "2005-01-30" "1.38" "SmokePing"
.SH "NAME"
smokeping_config \- Reference for the SmokePing Config File
.SH "OVERVIEW"
.IX Header "OVERVIEW"
SmokePing takes its configuration from a single central configuration file.
Its location must be hardcoded in the smokeping script and smokeping.cgi.
.PP
The contents of this manual is generated directly from the configuration
file parser.
.PP
The Parser for the Configuration file is written using David Schweikers
ParseConfig module. Read all about it in ISG::ParseConfig.
.PP
The Configuration file has a tree-like structure with section headings at
various levels. It also contains variable assignments and tables.
.SH "REFERENCE"
.IX Header "REFERENCE"
The text below describes the syntax of the SmokePing configuration file.
.Sh "*** General *** \fI(mandatory section)\fP"
.IX Subsection "*** General *** (mandatory section)"
General configuration values valid for the whole SmokePing setup.
.PP
The following variables can be set in this section:
.IP "\fBowner\fR \fI(mandatory setting)\fR" 4
.IX Item "owner (mandatory setting)"
Name of the person responsible for this smokeping installation.
.IP "\fBimgcache\fR \fI(mandatory setting)\fR" 4
.IX Item "imgcache (mandatory setting)"
A directory which is visible on your webserver where SmokePing can cache graphs.
.IP "\fBimgurl\fR \fI(mandatory setting)\fR" 4
.IX Item "imgurl (mandatory setting)"
Either an absolute \s-1URL\s0 to the \fBimgcache\fR directory or one relative to the directory where you keep the
SmokePing cgi.
.IP "\fBdatadir\fR \fI(mandatory setting)\fR" 4
.IX Item "datadir (mandatory setting)"
The directory where SmokePing can keep its rrd files.
.IP "\fBpagedir\fR" 4
.IX Item "pagedir"
Directory to store static representations of pages.
.IP "\fBpiddir\fR \fI(mandatory setting)\fR" 4
.IX Item "piddir (mandatory setting)"
The directory where SmokePing keeps its pid when daemonised.
.IP "\fBsendmail\fR" 4
.IX Item "sendmail"
Path to your sendmail binary. It will be used for sending mails in connection with the support of \s-1DYNAMIC\s0 addresses.			     
.IP "\fBoffset\fR" 4
.IX Item "offset"
If you run many instances of smokeping you may want to prevent them from
hitting your network all at the same time. Using the offset parameter you
can change the point in time when the probes are run. Offset is specified
in % of total interval, or alternatively as 'random'. I recommend to use
\&'random'. Note that this does \s-1NOT\s0 influence the rrds itself, it is just a
matter of when data acqusition is initiated.  The default offset is 'random'.
.IP "\fBsmokemail\fR \fI(mandatory setting)\fR" 4
.IX Item "smokemail (mandatory setting)"
Path to the mail template for \s-1DYNAMIC\s0 hosts. This mail template
must contain keywords of the form \fB<##\fR\fIkeyword\fR\fB##>\fR. There is a sample
template included with SmokePing.
.IP "\fBcgiurl\fR \fI(mandatory setting)\fR" 4
.IX Item "cgiurl (mandatory setting)"
Complete \s-1URL\s0 path of the SmokePing.cgi
.IP "\fBmailhost\fR" 4
.IX Item "mailhost"
Instead of using sendmail, you can specify the name of an smtp server 
and use perl's Net::SMTP module to send mail to \s-1DYNAMIC\s0 host owners (see below).
.IP "\fBcontact\fR \fI(mandatory setting)\fR" 4
.IX Item "contact (mandatory setting)"
Mail address of the person responsible for this smokeping installation.
.IP "\fBnetsnpp\fR" 4
.IX Item "netsnpp"
.PD 0
.IP "\fBsyslogfacility\fR" 4
.IX Item "syslogfacility"
.PD
The syslog facility to use, eg. local0...local7. 
Note: syslog logging is only used if you specify this.
.IP "\fBsyslogpriority\fR" 4
.IX Item "syslogpriority"
The syslog priority to use, eg. debug, notice or info. 
Default is info.
.IP "\fBconcurrentprobes\fR" 4
.IX Item "concurrentprobes"
If you use multiple probes or multiple instances of the same probe and you
want them to run concurrently in separate processes, set this to 'yes'. This
gives you the possibility to specify probe-specific step and offset parameters 
(see the 'Probes' section) for each probe and makes the probes unable to block
each other in cases of service outages. The default is 'yes', but if you for
some reason want the old behaviour you can set this to 'no'.
.IP "\fBchangeprocessnames\fR" 4
.IX Item "changeprocessnames"
When using 'concurrentprobes' (see above), this controls whether the probe
subprocesses should change their argv string to indicate their probe in
the process name.  If set to 'yes' (the default), the probe name will
be appended to the process name as '[probe]', eg.  '/usr/bin/smokeping
[FPing]'. If you don't like this behaviour, set this variable to 'no'.
If 'concurrentprobes' is not set to 'yes', this variable has no effect.
.Sh "*** Database *** \fI(mandatory section)\fP"
.IX Subsection "*** Database *** (mandatory section)"
Describes the properties of the round robin database for storing the
SmokePing data. Note that it is not possible to edit existing RRDs
by changing the entries in the cfg file.
.PP
The following variables can be set in this section:
.IP "\fBstep\fR \fI(mandatory setting)\fR" 4
.IX Item "step (mandatory setting)"
Duration of the base operation interval of SmokePing in seconds.
SmokePing will venture out every \fBstep\fR seconds to ping your target hosts.
If 'concurrent_probes' is set to 'yes' (see above), this variable can be 
overridden by each probe. Note that the step in the \s-1RRD\s0 files is fixed when 
they are originally generated, and if you change the step parameter afterwards, 
you'll have to delete the old \s-1RRD\s0 files or somehow convert them. 
.IP "\fBpings\fR \fI(mandatory setting)\fR" 4
.IX Item "pings (mandatory setting)"
How many pings should be sent to each target. Suggested: 20 pings.
This can be overridden by each probe. Some probes (those derived from
basefork.pm, ie. most except the FPing variants) will even let this
be overridden target-specifically in the \s-1PROBE_CONF\s0 section (see the
basefork documentation for details).  Note that the number of pings in
the \s-1RRD\s0 files is fixed when they are originally generated, and if you
change this parameter afterwards, you'll have to delete the old \s-1RRD\s0
files or somehow convert them.
.PP
This section also contains a table describing the setup of the
SmokePing database. Below are reasonable defaults. Only change them if
you know rrdtool and its workings. Each row in the table describes one \s-1RRA\s0.
.PP

.Sh "*** Presentation *** \fI(mandatory section)\fP"
.IX Subsection "*** Presentation *** (mandatory section)"
Defines how the SmokePing data should be presented.
.PP
The following variables can be set in this section:
.IP "\fBtemplate\fR \fI(mandatory setting)\fR" 4
.IX Item "template (mandatory setting)"
The webpage template must contain keywords of the form 
\&\fB<##\fR\fIkeyword\fR\fB##>\fR. There is a sample
template included with SmokePing; use it as the basis for your
experiments. Default template contains a pointer to the SmokePing
counter and homepage. I would be glad if you would not remove this as
it gives me an indication as to how widely used the tool is.

Duration of the base interval that this probe should use, if different

You can define multiple instances of the same probe with subsections. 
These instances can have different values for their variables, so you
can eg. have one instance of the FPing probe with packet size 1000 and
step 30 and another instance with packet size 64 and step 300.
The name of the subsection determines what the probe will be called, so
you can write descriptive names for the probes.

If there are any subsections defined, the main section for this probe

.Sh "*** Alerts ***"
.IX Subsection "*** Alerts ***"
The Alert section lets you setup loss and \s-1RTT\s0 pattern detectors. After each
round of polling, SmokePing will examine its data and determine which
detectors match. Detectors are enabled per target and get inherited by
the targets children.
.PP
Detectors are not just simple thresholds which go off at first sight
of a problem. They are configurable to detect special loss or \s-1RTT\s0
patterns. They let you look at a number of past readings to make a
more educated decision on what kind of alert should be sent, or if an
alert should be sent at all.
.PP
The patterns are numbers prefixed with an operator indicating the type
of comparison required for a match.
.PP
The following \s-1RTT\s0 pattern detects if a target's \s-1RTT\s0 goes from constantly
below 10ms to constantly 100ms and more:
.PP
.Vb 2
\& old ------------------------------> new
\& <10,<10,<10,<10,<10,>10,>100,>100,>100
.Ve
.PP
Loss patterns work in a similar way, except that the loss is defined as the
percentage the total number of received packets is of the total number of packets sent.
.PP
.Vb 2
\& old ------------------------------> new
\& ==0%,==0%,==0%,==0%,>20%,>20%,>=20%
.Ve
.PP
Apart from normal numbers, patterns can also contain the values \fB*\fR
which is true for all values regardless of the operator. And \fBU\fR
which is true for \fBunknown\fR data together with the \fB==\fR and \fB=!\fR operators.
.PP
Detectors normally act on state changes. This has the disadvantage, that
they will fail to find conditions which were already present when launching
smokeping. For this it is possible to write detectors that begin with the
special value \fB==S\fR it is inserted whenever smokeping is started up.
.PP
You can write
.PP
.Vb 1
\& ==S,>20%,>20%
.Ve
.PP
to detect lines that have been losing more than 20% of the packets for two
periods after startup.
.PP
Sometimes it may be that conditions occur at irregular intervals. But still
you only want to throw an alert if they occur several times within a certain
amount of times. The operator \fB*X*\fR will ignore up to \fIX\fR values and still
let the pattern match:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&  >10%,*10*,>10%
.Ve
.PP
will fire if more than 10% of the packets have been losst twice over the
last 10 samples.

.Sh "*** Targets *** \fI(mandatory section)\fP"
.IX Subsection "*** Targets *** (mandatory section)"
The Target Section defines the actual work of SmokePing. It contains a hierarchical list
of hosts which mark the endpoints of the network connections the system should monitor.
Each section can contain one host as well as other sections.
.PP
The following variables can be set in this section:
.IP "\fBprobe\fR \fI(mandatory setting)\fR" 4
.IX Item "probe (mandatory setting)"
The name of the probe module to be used for this host. The value of
this variable gets propagated
.IP "\fBmenu\fR \fI(mandatory setting)\fR" 4
.IX Item "menu (mandatory setting)"
Menu entry for this section. If not set this will be set to the hostname.
.IP "\fBtitle\fR \fI(mandatory setting)\fR" 4
.IX Item "title (mandatory setting)"
Title of the page when it is displayed. This will be set to the hostname if
left empty.
.IP "\fBremark\fR" 4
.IX Item "remark"
An optional remark on the current section. It gets displayed on the webpage.
.IP "\fBalerts\fR" 4
.IX Item "alerts"
A comma separated list of alerts to check for this target. The alerts have
to be setup in the Alerts section. Alerts are inherited by child nodes. Use
an empty alerts definition to remove inherited alerts from the current target
and its children.
.PP
The following sections are valid on level 1:
.IP "\fB+PROBE_CONF\fR" 4
.IX Item "+PROBE_CONF"
Probe specific variables.

.IP "\fB/[\-_0\-9a\-zA\-Z.]+/\fR" 4
.IX Item "/[-_0-9a-zA-Z.]+/"
Should be found in the documentation of the
corresponding probe. The values get propagated to those child
nodes using the same Probe.
.RE

.IP "\fBmenu\fR" 4
.IX Item "menu"
.IP "\fBtitle\fR" 4
.IX Item "title"
.IP "\fBalerts\fR" 4
.IX Item "alerts"
.PD
Comma separated list of alert names
.IP "\fBnote\fR" 4
.IX Item "note"
Some information about this entry which does \s-1NOT\s0 get displayed on the web.
.IP "\fBemail\fR" 4
.IX Item "email"
This is the contact address for the owner of the current host. In connection with the \fB\s-1DYNAMIC\s0\fR hosts,
the address will be used for sending the belowmentioned script.
.IP "\fBhost\fR" 4
.IX Item "host"
Can either contain the name of a target host or the string \fB\s-1DYNAMIC\s0\fR.
.Sp
In the second case, the target machine has a dynamic \s-1IP\s0 address and
thus is required to regularly contact the SmokePing server to verify
its \s-1IP\s0 address.  When starting SmokePing with the commandline argument
\&\fB\-\-email\fR it will add a secret password to each of the \fB\s-1DYNAMIC\s0\fR
host lines and send a script to the owner of each host. This script
must be started regularly on the host in question to make sure
SmokePing monitors the right box. If the target machine supports
\&\s-1SNMP\s0 SmokePing will also query the hosts
sysContact, sysName and sysLocation properties to make sure it is
still the same host.
.IP "\fBremark\fR" 4
.IX Item "remark"
.PD 0
.IP "\fBrawlog\fR" 4
.IX Item "rawlog"
.PD
Log the raw data, gathered for this target, in tab separated format, to a file with the
same basename as the corresponding \s-1RRD\s0 file. Use posix strftime to format the timestamp to be
put into the file name. The filename is built like this:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\& basename.strftime.csv
.Ve
.Sp
Example:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\& rawlog=%Y-%m-%d
.Ve
.Sp
this would create a new logfile every day with a name like this: 
.Sp
.Vb 1
\& targethost.2004-05-03.csv
.Ve
.IP "\fBalertee\fR" 4
.IX Item "alertee"
If you want to have alerts for this target and all targets below it go to a particular address
on top of the address already specified in the alert, you can add it here. This can be a comma separated list of items.
