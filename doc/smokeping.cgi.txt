       smokeping.cgi - SmokePing webfrontend

OOVVEERRVVIIEEWW
       This script acts as a 'website' for your SmokePing monitoring opera-
       tion. It presents the targets you are looking at in a tree structure
       and draws graphs as they are required by people looking at the pages.

DDEESSCCRRIIPPTTIIOONN
       To get ssmmookkeeppiinngg..ccggii going, you need a webserver which allows you to
       run cgi scripts. The system must be setup so that the ssmmookkeeppiinngg..ccggii is
       allowed to write to the image caching area as defined in the config
       file.

       This script runs with normal perl. BBUUTT it will appear to be very slow,
       because it does a lot of things when starting up. So if the script has
       to be started a fresh on every click, this is both slow and a tough
       thing for your webserver. I therefore strongly recomment using Speedy-
       CGI.

       Please refer to the installation document for detailed setup instruc-
       tions.

SSEETTUUPP
       When installing SmokePing, this file has to be adjusted to fit your
       local system. Three paths have to be entered.

        use lib qw(/usr/pack/rrdtool-1.0.33-to/lib/perl);

       One pointing to your rrrrddttooooll installation

        use lib qw(/home/oetiker/public_html/smokeping/lib);

       One pointing to the place where you have installed the SmokePing
       libraries

        use Smokeping;

        Smokeping::cgi("/home/oetiker/.smokeping/config");

       The third path is the argument to the Smokeping::cgi command. It points
       to the SmokePing configuration file.
