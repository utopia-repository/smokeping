       This script acts as a 'website' for your SmokePing moni-
       toring operation. It presents the targets you are looking
       at in a tree structure and draws graphs as they are
       required by people looking at the pages.

       allows you to run cgi scripts. The system must be setup so
       that the ssssmmmmooookkkkeeeeppppiiiinnnngggg....ccccggggiiii is allowed to write to the image
       caching area as defined in the config file.

       This script runs with normal perl. BBBBUUUUTTTT it will appear to
       be very slow, because it does a lot of things when start-
       ing up. So if the script has to be started a fresh on
       every click, this is both slow and a tough thing for your
       webserver. I therefore strongly recomment using SpeedyCGI.

       Please refer to the installation document for detailed
       setup instructions.

       When installing SmokePing, this file has to be adjusted to
       fit your local system. Three paths have to be entered.

        use lib qw(/usr/pack/rrdtool-1.0.33-to/lib/perl);

       One pointing to your rrrrrrrrddddttttoooooooollll installation

        use lib qw(/home/oetiker/public_html/smokeping/lib);

       One pointing to the place where you have installed the
       SmokePing libraries

        use Smokeping;

        Smokeping::cgi("/home/oetiker/.smokeping/config");

       The third path is the argument to the Smokeping::main com-
       mand. It points to the SmokePing configuration file.
