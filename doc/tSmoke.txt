       The ttSSmmookkee tool is a commandline tool which interfaces
       with the SmokePing system.  Its main function is to send a
       message indicating the current status of the systems being
       monitored by Smokeping or an HTML mail file containing the
       status over the past day, past week and past month includ-
       ing an overview.

       Typical crontab used to invoke this are

        # Quick morning alert to see what's down
        0 6 * * * /usr/local/smokeping/bin/tSmoke.pl --q --to=mobilephone@att.net.invalid --morning
        # Weekly report on the percent availability of network systems with no detail
        0 8 * * * /usr/local/smokeping/bin/tSmoke.pl --q --to=mailbox@company.com.invalid --weekly --detail=0

SSEETTUUPP
       When installing tSmoke, some variables must be adjusted to
       fit your local system.

       We need to use the following lliibbrraarriieess:

       Smokeping
       RRDTool Perl bindings
       Getopt::Long

       Set up your libraries:

        use lib "/usr/local/smokeping/lib";
        use lib "/usr/local/rrdtool-1.0.39/lib/perl";

       Point to your Smokeping ccoonnffiigg file

        my $cfgfile = "/usr/local/smokeping/etc/config";

       Modify the Smokeping config file to include a path for
       tmail in the General section:

        tmail = /usr/local/smokeping/etc/tmail
