       Smokeping.pm - SmokePing Perl Module

OOVVEERRVVIIEEWW
       Almost all SmokePing functionality sits in this Module.  The programs
       smokeping and smokeping.cgi are merely figure heads allowing to hard-
       code some pathnames.

       If you feel like documenting what is happening within this library you
       are most welcome todo so.
