       matchers::median - Find persistant change in latency

OOVVEERRVVIIEEWW
       The idea behind this matcher is to find sustained changes
       in latency.

       The median matcher takes a number of past median laten-
       cies. It splits the latencies into two groups (old and
       new) and again finds the median for each groups. If the
       difference between the two medians is bigger than a cer-
       tain value, it will give a match.

DDEESSCCRRIIPPTTIIOONN
       Call the matcher with the following sequence:

        type = matcher
        pattern =  median(old=>x,new=>y,diff=>z)

       This will create a matcher which consumes x+y latency-dat-
       apoints, builds the two medians and the matches if the
       difference between the median latency is larger than z
       seconds.
