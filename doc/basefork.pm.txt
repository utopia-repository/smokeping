       Like probes::basevars, but supports the probe-specific
       property `forks' to determine how many processes should be
       run concurrently.

       Not all pinger programs support testing multiple hosts in
       a single go like _f_p_i_n_g(1). If the measurement takes long
       enough, there may be not enough time perform all the tests
       in the time available. For example, if the test takes 30
       seconds, measuring ten hosts already fills up the
       SmokePing default five minute step.

       Thus, it may be necessary to do some of the tests concur-
       rently. This module defines the ppppiiiinnnngggg method that forks the
       requested number of concurrent processes and calls the
       ppppiiiinnnnggggoooonnnneeee method that derived classes must provide.

       The ppppiiiinnnnggggoooonnnneeee method is called with one argument: a hash
       containing the target that is to be measured. The contents
       of the hash are described in _p_r_o_b_e_s_:_:_b_a_s_e_v_a_r_s(3pm).

       The number of concurrent processes is determined by the
       probe-specific variable `forks' and is 5 by default. If
       there are more targets than this value, another round of
       forks is done after the first processes are finished. This
       continues until all the targets have been tested.

       Doesn't signal failures in child processes, partly because
       SmokePing hasn't any logging features after daemonization.
