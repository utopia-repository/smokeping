       Integrates FPing as a probe into smokeping. The variable
       bbiinnaarryy must point to your copy of the FPing program. If it
       is not installed on your system yet, you can get it from
       http://www.fping.com/.

       The (optional) packetsize option lets you configure the
       packetsize for the pings sent.  The FPing manpage has the
       following to say on this topic:

       Number of bytes of ping data to send.  The minimum size
       (normally 12) allows room for the data that fping needs to
       do its work (sequence number, timestamp).  The reported
       received data size includes the IP header (normally 20
       bytes) and ICMP header (8 bytes), so the minimum total
       size is 40 bytes.  Default is 56, as in ping. Maximum is
       the theoretical maximum IP datagram size (64K), though
       most systems limit this to a smaller, system-dependent
       number.
