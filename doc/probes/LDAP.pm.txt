       This probe measures LDAP query latency for SmokePing.  The
       query is specified by the target-specific variable `fil-
       ter' and, optionally, by the target-specific variable
       `base'. The attributes queried can be specified in the
       comma-separated list `attrs'.

       The TCP port of the LDAP server and the LDAP version to be
       used can be specified by the variables `port' and `ver-
       sion'.

       The probe can issue the starttls command to convert the
       connection into encrypted mode, if so instructed by the
       `start_tls' variable.  It can also optionally do an
       authenticated LDAP bind, if the `binddn' variable is pre-
       sent. The password to be used can be specified by the tar-
       get-specific variable `password' or in an external file.
       The location of this file is given in the probe-specific
       variable `passwordfile'. See _p_r_o_b_e_s_:_:_p_a_s_s_w_o_r_d_c_h_e_c_k_e_r(3pm)
       for the format of this file (summary: colon-separated
       triplets of the form `<host>:<bind-dn>:<password>')

       The probe tries to be nice to the server and sleeps for
       the probe-specific variable `sleeptime' (one second by
       default) between each authentication request.

       There should be a way of specifying TLS options, such as
       the certificates involved etc.

       The probe has an ugly way of working around the fact that
       the IO::Socket::SSL class complains if _s_t_a_r_t___t_l_s_(_) is done
       more than once in the same program. But It Works For Me
       (tm).
