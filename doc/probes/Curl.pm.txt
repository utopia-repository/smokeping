       Supported probe-specific variables:

       binary
           The location of your curl binary.

       forks
           The number of concurrent processes to be run. See
           _p_r_o_b_e_s_:_:_b_a_s_e_f_o_r_k(3pm) for details.

       url The URL to fetch.  Can be any one that curl supports.
           Note that if this variable is present, it overrides
           the 'host' variable for the actual target pinged.
           Still, 'host' must be present in those targets that
           should be pinged, and its contents will show up on the
           graphs.

       Supported target-level probe variables (see _c_u_r_l(1) for
       details of the options):

       agent
           The "-A" _c_u_r_l(1) option.  This is a full HTTP User-
           Agent header including the words "User-Agent:".  It
           should be enclosed in quotes if it contains shell
           metacharacters

       ssl2
           The "-2" _c_u_r_l(1) option.  Force SSL2.

       insecure_ssl
           The "-k" _c_u_r_l(1) option. Accept SSL connections that
           don't have a secure certificate chain to a trusted CA.
           Note that if you are going to monitor https targets,
           you'll probably have to either enable this option or
           specify the CA path to curl through "extraargs" below.
           For more info, see the _c_u_r_l(1) manual page.

       timeout
           The "-m" _c_u_r_l(1) option.  Maximum timeout in seconds.

       interface
           The "--interface" _c_u_r_l(1) option.  Bind to a specific
           interface, IP address or host name.

       extraargs
           Put any extra _c_u_r_l(1) options you want on the right
           side of the equals and they will be used when execut-
           ing the command.
