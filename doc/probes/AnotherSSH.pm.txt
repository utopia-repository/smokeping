       Latency measurement using SSH. This generates Logfile mes-
       sages on the other Host, so get permission from the owner
       first!

       forks
           The number of concurrent processes to be run. See
           _p_r_o_b_e_s_:_:_b_a_s_e_f_o_r_k(3pm) for details.

       Supported target-level probe variables:

       greeting
           Greeting string to send to the SSH Server. This will
           appear in the Logfile.  Use this to make clear, who
           you are and what you are doing to avoid confusion.

           Also, don't use something that is a valid version
           string. This probe assumes that the connection gets
           terminated because of protocol mismatch.

       sleeptime
           Time to sleep between two measurements in microsends.
           Default is 500000.

       interval
           The interval to measure

           connect
               Interval between _c_o_n_n_e_c_t_(_) and the greeting string
               from the host.

           established
               Interval between our greeting message and the end
               of the connection because of Protocol mismatch.
               This is the default.

           complete
               From _c_o_n_n_e_c_t_(_) to the end of the connection.

       timeout
           Timeout for the connection. Default is 5.

       port
           Connect to this port. Default is 22.
