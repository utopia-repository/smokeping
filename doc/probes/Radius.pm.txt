       This probe measures RADIUS (RFC 2865) authentication
       latency for SmokePing.

       The username to be tested is specified in either the
       probe-specific or the target-specific variable `username',
       with the target-specific one overriding the probe-specific
       one.

       The password can be specified either (in order of prece-
       dence, with the latter overriding the former) in the
       probe-specific variable `password', in the target-specific
       variable `password' or in an external file.  The location
       of this file is given in the probe-specific variable
       `passwordfile'. See _p_r_o_b_e_s_:_:_p_a_s_s_w_o_r_d_c_h_e_c_k_e_r(3pm) for the
       format of this file (summary: colon-separated triplets of
       the form `<host>:<username>:<password>')

       The RADIUS protocol requires a shared secret between the
       server and the client.  This secret can be specified
       either (in order of precedence, with the latter overriding
       the former) in the probe-specific variable `secret', in
       the target-specific variable `secret' or in an external
       file.  This external file is located by the probe-specific
       variable `secretfile', and it should contain whitespace-
       separated pairs of the form `<host> <secret>'. Comments
       and blank lines are OK.

       If the optional probe-specific variable `nas_ip_address'
       is specified, its value is inserted into the authentica-
       tion requests as the `NAS-IP-Address' RADIUS attribute.

       The probe tries to be nice to the server and sleeps for
       the probe-specific variable `sleeptime' (one second by
       default) between each authentication request.

       There should be a more general way of specifying RADIUS
       attributes.
