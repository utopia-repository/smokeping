       Like DNS, but uses Net::DNS and Time::HiRes instead of
       dig. This probe does *not* retry the request three times
       before it is considerd "lost", like dig and other resolver
       do by default. If operating as caching Nameserver, BIND
       (and maybe others) expect clients to retry the request if
       the answer is not in the cache. So, ask the nameserver for
       something that he is authorative for if you want measure
       the network packet loss correctly.

       If you have a really fast network and nameserver, you will
       notice that this probe reports the query time in microsec-
       ond resolution. :-)

       forks
           The number of concurrent processes to be run. See
           _p_r_o_b_e_s_:_:_b_a_s_e_f_o_r_k(3pm) for details.

       Supported target-level probe variables:

       lookup
           Name of the host to look up in the dns.

       sleeptime
           Time to sleep between two lookups in microseconds.
           Default is 500000.

       recordtype
           Record type to look up. Default is "A".

       timeout
           Timeout for a single request in seconds. Default is 5.

       port
           UDP Port to use. Default is 53. (Surprise!)
