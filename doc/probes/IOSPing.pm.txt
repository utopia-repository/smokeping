       Integrates Cisco IOS as a probe into smokeping.  Uses the
       rsh / remsh protocol to run a ping from an IOS device.

       The binary and ioshost options are mandatory.

       The binary option specifies the path of the binary to be
       used to connect to the IOS device.  Commonly used binaries
       are /usr/bin/rsh and /usr/bin/remsh, although any script
       or binary should work if can be called as

           /path/to/binary [ -l user ] router ping

       to produce the IOS ping dialog on stdin & stdout.

       The (optional) packetsize option lets you configure the
       packetsize for the pings sent.

       The (optional) forks options lets you configure the number
       of simultaneous remote pings to be run.  NB Some IOS
       devices have a maximum of 5 VTYs available, so be careful
       not to hit a limit.

       The ioshost option specifies the IOS device which should
       be used for the ping.

       The (optional) iosuser option allows you to specify the
       remote username the IOS device.  If this option is omit-
       ted, the username defaults to the default user used by the
       remsh command (usually the user running the remsh command,
       ie the user running SmokePing).

       The (optional) iosint option allows you to specify the
       source address or interface in the IOS device. The value
       should be an IP address or an interface name such as "Eth-
       ernet 1/0". If this option is omitted, the IOS device will
       pick the IP address of the outbound interface to use.

IIOOSS CCOONNFFIIGGUURRAATTIIOONN
       The IOS device must have rsh enabled and an appropriate
       trust defined, eg:

           !
           ip rcmd rsh-enable
           ip rcmd remote-host smoke 192.168.1.2 smoke enable
           !

       It is not possible to use password authentication with rsh
       or remsh due to fundamental limitations of the protocol.

       The FPing manpage has the following to say on the topic of
       ping packet size:

       Number of bytes of ping data to send.  The minimum size
       (normally 12) allows room for the data that fping needs to
       do its work (sequence number, timestamp).  The reported
       received data size includes the IP header (normally 20
       bytes) and ICMP header (8 bytes), so the minimum total
       size is 40 bytes.  Default is 56, as in ping. Maximum is
       the theoretical maximum IP datagram size (64K), though
       most systems limit this to a smaller, system-dependent
       number.
