       Integrates the remote execution of FPing via ssh/rsh into
       smokeping.  The variable bbiinnaarryy must point to your copy of
       the ssh/rsh program.

OOPPTTIIOONNSS
       The bbiinnaarryy and rrhhoosstt are mandatory. The bbiinnaarryy option
       specifies the path of the remote shell program (usually
       ssh, rsh or remsh). Any other script or binary that can be
       called as

        binary [ -l ruser ] rhost rbinary

       may be used.

       The (optional) ppaacckkeettssiizzee option lets you configure the
       packetsize for the pings sent.

       The rrhhoosstt option specifies the remote device from where
       fping will be launched.

       The (optional) rruusseerr option allows you to specify the
       remote user, if different from the one running the
       smokeping daemon.

       The (optional) rrbbiinnaarryy option allows you to specify the
       location of the remote fping binary. If not specified the
       probe will assume that fping is in the remote host's path.

NNOOTTEESS
       It is important to make sure that you can access the
       remote machine without a password prompt, otherwise this
       probe will not work properly.  To test just try something
       like this:

           $ ssh foo@HostA.foobar.com fping HostB.barfoo.com

       The next thing you see must be fping's output.

       The rrhhoosstt, rruusseerr and rrbbiinnaarryy variables used to be config-
       ured in the PROBE_CONF section of the first target or its
       parents They were moved to the Probes section, because the
       variables aren't really target-specific (all the targets
       are measured with the same parameters). The PROBE_CONF
       sections aren't recognized anymore.
