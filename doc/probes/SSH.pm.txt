       Integrates ssh-keyscan as a probe into smokeping. The
       variable bbiinnaarryy must point to your copy of the ssh-keyscan
       program. If it is not installed on your system yet, you
       should install openssh >= 3.8p1

       The Probe asks the given host n-times for it's public key.
       Where n is the amount specified in the config File.

       Supported probe-specific variables:

       binary
           The location of your ssh-keyscan binary.

       forks
           The number of concurrent processes to be run. See
           _p_r_o_b_e_s_:_:_b_a_s_e_f_o_r_k(3pm) for details.

       Supported target-level probe variables:
