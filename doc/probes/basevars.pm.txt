       probes::basevars - Another Base Class for implementing
       SmokePing Probes

       Like probes::base, but supports host-specific variables
       for the probe.

       Provides the method `targets' that returns a list of
       hashes.  The hashes contain the entries:

       addr
           The address of the target.

       vars
           A hash containing variables defined in the correspond-
           ing `PROBE_CONF' config section.

       tree
           The unique index that `probe::base' uses for targets.

           There's also the method 'vars' that returns the above-
           mentioned hash corresponding to the 'tree' index
           parameter.

       Uses `probes::base' internals too much to be a derived
       class, but I didn't want to touch the base class directly.
