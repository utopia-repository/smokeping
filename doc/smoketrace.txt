       SmokeTrace - Ajax based Traceroute for Smokeping

DDEESSCCRRIIPPTTIIOONN
       SmokeTraceoute is an browser based traceroute application written in
       the Qooxdoo. You can easily activate it in your Smokeping setup, to
       allow users to traceroute smokeping targets directly from the master
       host.

SSEETTUUPP
       To activate SmokeTrace you just have to copy a few files:

       1.  Copy _h_t_d_o_c_s_/_s_c_r_i_p_t_/_T_r_._j_s to your smokeping web directory.

       2.  Copy and edit _h_t_d_o_c_s_/_t_r_._h_t_m_l to your smokeping web directory. Make
           sure the path to _T_r_._j_s is correct.

       3.  Copy _h_t_d_o_c_s_/_r_e_s_o_u_r_c_e into the directory where you put _t_r_._h_t_m_l.

       4.  Copy and edit _h_t_d_o_c_s_/_t_r_._c_g_i_._d_i_s_t to the directory where you put
           _t_r_._h_t_m_l and change its name to _t_r_._c_g_i. Make sure _t_r_._c_g_i to adjust
           the _u_s_e _l_i_b line to point to the smokeping per lib directory, as
           you did with _s_m_o_k_e_p_i_n_g_._c_g_i. Make sure the webserver actually exe-
           cutes the _t_r_._c_g_i script.

       5.  Edit your config file and add the line:

            menuextra = <a target='_blank' href='tr.html{HOST}' class='{CLASS}' \
               onclick="window.open(this.href,this.target, \
               'width=800,height=500,toolbar=no,location=no,status=no,scrollbars=no'); \
               return false;">*</a>

           to your _*_*_* _T_a_r_g_e_t_s _*_*_* section. It will make a '*' appear next to
           each host name, and when you click on it, the SmokeTrace window
           will open.
