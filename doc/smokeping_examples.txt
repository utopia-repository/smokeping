       smokeping_examples - Examples of Smokeping configuration

OOVVEERRVVIIEEWW
       This document provides some examples of Smokeping configu-
       ration files.  All the examples can be found in the "exam-
       ples" directory in the Smokeping documentation. Note that
       the DNS names in the examples are non-functional.

       Details of the syntax and all the variables are found in
       smokeping_config and in the documentation of the corre-
       sponding probe, if applicable.

       This manual is automatically generated from the Smokeping
       source code, specifically the Smokeping::Examples module.

       Currently the examples differ only in the "Probes" and
       "Targets" sections. The other sections are taken from the
       "etc/config.dist" configuration template in the Smokeping
       distribution so that the example files are complete.

       If you would like to provide more examples, document the
       other sections or enhance the existing examples, please do
       so, preferably by sending the proposed changes to the
       smokeping-users mailing list.

       Probe configuration
            *** Probes ***
            +FPing
            binary = /usr/bin/fping

       Probe explanation
           Here we have just one probe, fping, pinging four
           hosts.

           The fping probe is using the default parameters, some
           of them supplied from the Database section ("step" and
           "pings"), and some of them by the probe module.

       Target configuration
            *** Targets ***
            probe = FPing

            menu = Top

            + mysite1
            menu = Site 1
            title = Hosts in Site 1

            ++ myhost1
            host = myhost1.mysite1.example
            ++ myhost2
            host = myhost2.mysite1.example



            + mysite2
            menu = Site 2
            title = Hosts in Site 2

            host = myhost3.mysite2.example
            ++ myhost4
            host = myhost4.mysite2.example

       Target explanation
           The hosts are located in two sites of two hosts each,
           and the configuration has been divided to site sec-
           tions ('+') and host subsections ('++') accordingly.

       Probe configuration
            *** Probes ***
            + FPing
            binary = /usr/bin/fping
            packetsize = 1000

            + DNS
            binary = /usr/bin/dig
            lookup = name.example
            pings = 5
            step = 180

            + EchoPingHttp
            pings = 5
            url = /test-url

       Probe explanation
           Here we have three probes: FPing for the regular ICMP
           pings, DNS for name server latency measurement and
           EchoPingHttp for web servers.

           The FPing probe runs with the default parameters,
           except that the ICMP packet size is 1000 bytes instead
           of the default 56 bytes.

           The DNS and EchoPingHttp probes have been configured
           to be a bit more gentle with the servers, as they only
           do 5 queries (pings) instead of the default 20 (or
           whatever is specified in the Database section). How-
           ever, DNS queries are made more often: 5 queries every
           3 minutes instead of every 5 minutes.

            host = www1.example

            +++ www2
            host = www2.example

       Target explanation
           The target tree has been divided by the probe used.
           This does not have to be the case: every target
           (sub)section can use a different probe, and the same
           probe can be used in different parts of the config
           tree.

       Probe configuration
            *** Probes ***
            + FPing
            binary = /usr/bin/fping

            ++ FPingNormal
            offset = 0%

            ++ FPingLarge
            packetsize = 5000
            offset = 50%

       Probe explanation
           This example demonstrates the concept of probe
           instances. The FPingLarge and FPingNormal probes are
           independent of each other, they just use the same mod-
           ule, FPing. FPingNormal uses the default parameters,
           and so does FPingLarge except for the 5 kilobyte pack-
           etsize. Both use the same fping binary, and its path
           is configured FPing top section.

           The 'offset' parameters make sure the probes don't run
           at the same time - FPingNormal is run every 'full' 5
           minutes (eg. 8:00, 8:05, 8:10 and so on, in wallclock
           time) while FPingLarge is run halfway through these
           intervals (eg. 8:02:30, 8:07:30 etc.)

           The top FPing section does not define a probe in
           itself because it has subsections. If we really wanted
           to have one probe named "FPing", we could do so by
           making a subsection by that name.

       Target configuration
            *** Targets ***
            probe = FPingNormal

            title = ICMP latency for myhost1

            +++ normal
            title = Normal packetsize (56 bytes)
            probe = FPingNormal
            host = myhost1.example

            probe = FPingLarge
            host = myhost1.example

            ++ myhost2
            menu = myhost2
            title = ICMP latency for myhost2

            +++ normal
            title = Normal packetsize (56 bytes)
            probe = FPingNormal
            host = myhost2.example

            +++ large
            title = Large packetsize (5000 bytes)
            probe = FPingLarge
            host = myhost2.example

       Target explanation
           The target section shows two host, myhost1.example and
           myhost2.example, being pinged with two differently
           sized ICMP packets. This time the tree is divided by
           the target host rather than the probe.

       Probe configuration
            *** Probes ***
            + Curl
            # probe-specific variables
            binary = /usr/bin/curl
            step = 60

            # a default for this target-specific variable
            urlformat = http://%host/

       Probe explanation
           This example explains the difference between probe-
           and target-specific variables. We use the Curl probe
           for this.

           Every probe supports at least some probe-specific
           variables. The values of these variables are common to
           all the targets of the probe, and they can only be
           configured in the Probes section. In this case, the
           probe-specific variables are "binary" and "step".

           Target-specific variables are supported by most
           probes, the most notable exception being the FPing
           probe and its derivatives. Target-specific variables
           can have different values for different targets. They
           can be configured in both Probes and Targets sections.
           The values assigned in the Probes section function
           become default values that can be overridden in the
           Targets section.

           The documentation of each probe states which of its
           variables are probe-specific and which are target-spe-
           cific.

           In this case the "urlformat" variable is a target-spe-
           cific one.  It is also quite uncommon, because it can
           contain a placeholder for the "host" variable in the
           Targets section. This is not a general feature, its
           usage is only limited to the "urlformat" variable and
           the "%host%" escape.

           (The reason why the FPing probe does not support tar-
           get-specific variables is simply the fact that the
           fping program measures all its targets in one go, so
           they all have the same parameters. The other probes
           ping their targets one at a time.)

            title = HTTP latency for myhost3 (port 8080!)
            host = myhost3.example

            menu = ftp

            ++ myhost1
            menu = myhost1
            title = FTP latency for myhost1
            host = myhost1.example

            ++ myhost2
            menu = myhost2
            title = FTP latency for myhost2
            host = myhost2.example

       Target explanation
           The target tree is divided into an HTTP branch and an
           FTP one.  The servers "myhost1.example" and
           "myhost2.example" are probed in both. The third
           server, "myhost3.example", only has an HTTP server,
           and it's in a non-standard port (8080).

           The "urlformat" variable is specified for the whole
           FTP branch as "ftp://%host%/". For the HTTP branch,
           the default from the Probes section is used, except
           for myhost3, which overrides it to tag the port number
           into the URL.

           The myhost3 assignment could just as well have
           included the hostname verbatim (ie. urlformat =
           http://myhost3.example:8080/) instead of using the
           %host% placeholder, but the host variable would still
           have been required (even though it wouldn't have been
           used for anything).

           probe) and their respective echoping probe. The proxy
           server, www-cache, is probed with both HTTP requests
           and ICP requests for the same URL.
