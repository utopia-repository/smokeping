       smokeping_examples - Examples of Smokeping configuration

OOVVEERRVVIIEEWW
       This document provides some examples of Smokeping configuration files.
       All the examples can be found in the "examples" directory in the
       Smokeping documentation. Note that the DNS names in the examples are
       non-functional.

       Details of the syntax and all the variables are found in smokeping_con-
       fig and in the documentation of the corresponding probe, if applicable.

       This manual is automatically generated from the Smokeping source code,
       specifically the Smokeping::Examples module.

       Currently the examples differ only in the "Probes" and "Targets" sec-
       tions. The other sections are taken from the "etc/config.dist" configu-
       ration template in the Smokeping distribution so that the example files
       are complete.

       If you would like to provide more examples, document the other sections
       or enhance the existing examples, please do so, preferably by sending
       the proposed changes to the smokeping-users mailing list.

       Probe configuration
            *** Probes ***
            +FPing
            binary = /usr/bin/fping

       Probe explanation
           Here we have just one probe, fping, pinging four hosts.

           The fping probe is using the default parameters, some of them sup-
           plied from the Database section ("step" and "pings"), and some of
           them by the probe module.

       Target configuration
            *** Targets ***
            probe = FPing

            menu = Top
            title = Network Latency Grapher
            remark = Welcome to this SmokePing website.

            + mysite1
            menu = Site 1
            title = Hosts in Site 1

            ++ myhost1
            host = myhost1.mysite1.example
            ++ myhost2
            host = myhost2.mysite1.example

            + mysite2
            menu = Site 2
            title = Hosts in Site 2

            ++ myhost3
            host = myhost3.mysite2.example
            ++ myhost4
            host = myhost4.mysite2.example

       Target explanation
           The hosts are located in two sites of two hosts each, and the con-
           figuration has been divided to site sections ('+') and host subsec-
           tions ('++') accordingly.

       Probe configuration
            *** Probes ***
            + FPing
            binary = /usr/bin/fping
            packetsize = 1000

            + DNS
            binary = /usr/bin/dig
            lookup = name.example
            pings = 5
            step = 180

            + EchoPingHttp
            pings = 5
            url = /test-url

       Probe explanation
           Here we have three probes: FPing for the regular ICMP pings, DNS
           for name server latency measurement and EchoPingHttp for web
           servers.

           The FPing probe runs with the default parameters, except that the
           ICMP packet size is 1000 bytes instead of the default 56 bytes.

           The DNS and EchoPingHttp probes have been configured to be a bit
           more gentle with the servers, as they only do 5 queries (pings)
           instead of the default 20 (or whatever is specified in the Database
           section). However, DNS queries are made more often: 5 queries every
           3 minutes instead of every 5 minutes.

            host = www1.example

            +++ www2
            host = www2.example

       Target explanation
           The target tree has been divided by the probe used. This does not
           have to be the case: every target (sub)section can use a different
           probe, and the same probe can be used in different parts of the
           config tree.

       Probe configuration
            *** Probes ***
            + FPing
            binary = /usr/bin/fping

            ++ FPingNormal
            offset = 0%

            ++ FPingLarge
            packetsize = 5000
            offset = 50%

       Probe explanation
           This example demonstrates the concept of probe instances. The
           FPingLarge and FPingNormal probes are independent of each other,
           they just use the same module, FPing. FPingNormal uses the default
           parameters, and so does FPingLarge except for the 5 kilobyte pack-
           etsize. Both use the same fping binary, and its path is configured
           FPing top section.

           The 'offset' parameters make sure the probes don't run at the same
           time - FPingNormal is run every 'full' 5 minutes (eg. 8:00, 8:05,
           8:10 and so on, in wallclock time) while FPingLarge is run halfway
           through these intervals (eg. 8:02:30, 8:07:30 etc.)

           The top FPing section does not define a probe in itself because it
           has subsections. If we really wanted to have one probe named
           "FPing", we could do so by making a subsection by that name.

       Target configuration
            *** Targets ***
            probe = FPingNormal

            title = Normal packetsize (56 bytes)
            probe = FPingNormal
            host = myhost1.example

            title = Large packetsize (5000 bytes)
            probe = FPingLarge
            host = myhost1.example

            ++ myhost2
            menu = myhost2
            title = ICMP latency for myhost2

            +++ normal
            title = Normal packetsize (56 bytes)
            probe = FPingNormal
            host = myhost2.example

            +++ large
            title = Large packetsize (5000 bytes)
            probe = FPingLarge
            host = myhost2.example

       Target explanation
           The target section shows two host, myhost1.example and
           myhost2.example, being pinged with two differently sized ICMP pack-
           ets. This time the tree is divided by the target host rather than
           the probe.

       Probe configuration
            *** Probes ***
            + Curl
            # probe-specific variables
            binary = /usr/bin/curl
            step = 60

            # a default for this target-specific variable
            urlformat = http://%host/

       Probe explanation
           This example explains the difference between probe- and target-spe-
           cific variables. We use the Curl probe for this.

           Every probe supports at least some probe-specific variables. The
           values of these variables are common to all the targets of the
           probe, and they can only be configured in the Probes section. In
           this case, the probe-specific variables are "binary" and "step".

           Target-specific variables are supported by most probes, the most
           notable exception being the FPing probe and its derivatives. Tar-
           get-specific variables can have different values for different tar-
           gets. They can be configured in both Probes and Targets sections.
           The values assigned in the Probes section function become default
           values that can be overridden in the Targets section.

           The documentation of each probe states which of its variables are
           probe-specific and which are target-specific.

           In this case the "urlformat" variable is a target-specific one.  It
           is also quite uncommon, because it can contain a placeholder for
           the "host" variable in the Targets section. This is not a general
           feature, its usage is only limited to the "urlformat" variable and
           the "%host%" escape.

           (The reason why the FPing probe does not support target-specific
           variables is simply the fact that the fping program measures all
           its targets in one go, so they all have the same parameters. The
           other probes ping their targets one at a time.)

            title = HTTP latency for myhost3 (port 8080!)
            host = myhost3.example
            urlformat = http://%host%:8080/

            menu = ftp
            title = FTP latency

            menu = myhost1
            title = FTP latency for myhost1
            host = myhost1.example

            ++ myhost2
            menu = myhost2
            title = FTP latency for myhost2
            host = myhost2.example

       Target explanation
           The target tree is divided into an HTTP branch and an FTP one.  The
           servers "myhost1.example" and "myhost2.example" are probed in both.
           The third server, "myhost3.example", only has an HTTP server, and
           it's in a non-standard port (8080).

           The "urlformat" variable is specified for the whole FTP branch as
           "ftp://%host%/". For the HTTP branch, the default from the Probes
           section is used, except for myhost3, which overrides it to tag the
           port number into the URL.

           The myhost3 assignment could just as well have included the host-
           name verbatim (ie. urlformat = http://myhost3.example:8080/)
           instead of using the %host% placeholder, but the host variable
           would still have been required (even though it wouldn't have been
           used for anything).

           probed with both HTTP requests and ICP requests for the same URL.
