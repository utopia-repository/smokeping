       Smokeping::probes::WebProxyFilter - tests webproxy filter performance
       and function.

OOVVEERRVVIIEEWW
       This probe tests if your filtering webproxy is working properly. Draw-
       ing from a list of forbidden websites, it tries to establish a connec-
       tion to each one of them and registers a 'loss' when it suceeeds.

       If you want to test availability of a website, use the EchoPingHttp
       probe.

       The probe uses the LWP::UserAgent module to retreive a series of
       wepages. It expects to get the firewalls 'site-prohibited' page. Any
       other response (or a real loss) gets logged as a loss and can be used
       to trigger an alarm.

       The probe tries to be nice to the firewall and waits at least X seconds
       between starting filetransfers, where X is the value of the probe spe-
       cific `min_interval' variable (1 by default).

       Many variables can be specified either in the probe or in the target
       definition, the target-specific variable will override the prove-spe-
       cific variable.

       Supported probe-specific variables:

       forks
           Run this many concurrent processes at maximum

           Example value: 5

           Default value: 5

       maxsize
           How much of the webpage should be retreived.

           Default value: 2000

       min_interval
           The minimum interval between each starting GETs in seconds.

           Example value: 0.1

           Default value: 1

       offset
           If you run many probes concurrently you may want to prevent them
           from hitting your network all at the same time. Using the probe-
           specific offset parameter you can change the point in time when
           each probe will be run. Offset is specified in % of total interval,
           or alternatively as 'random', and the offset from the 'General'
           section is used if nothing is specified here. Note that this does
           NOT influence the rrds itself, it is just a matter of when data
           acqusition is initiated.  (This variable is only applicable if the
           variable 'concurrentprobes' is set in the 'General' section.)

           Example value: 50%

       step
           Duration of the base interval that this probe should use, if dif-
           ferent from the one specified in the 'Database' section. Note that
           the step in the RRD files is fixed when they are originally gener-
           ated, and if you change the step parameter afterwards, you'll have
           to delete the old RRD files or somehow convert them. (This variable
           is only applicable if the variable 'concurrentprobes' is set in the
           'General' section.)

           Example value: 300

       timeout
           How long a single 'ping' takes at maximum

           Example value: 15

           Default value: 5

       useragent
           The web browser we claim to be, just in case the FW is interested

           Default value: SmokePing/2.x (WebProxyFilter Probe)

       Supported target-specific variables:

       deny_re
           Regular expression, matching the 'deny' response from the firewall

           Example value: Access Prohibited

       more_hosts
           A comma separated list of banned websites to test in addition to
           the one specified in the _h_o_s_t variable. The websites will be tested
           one after the other in one round, this means that while normal
           probes do run the same test serveral times in a row, this one will
           alter the webpage with each round.  The reason for this is, that
           eventhough we try to retreive remote webpages, the answer will come
           from the firewall everytime, so we kill two birds in one go. First
           we test the firewalls latency and second we make sure its filter
           works properly.

           Example value: www.playboy.com, www.our-competition.com

       pings
           How many pings should be sent to each target, if different from the
           global value specified in the Database section. Note that the num-
           ber of pings in the RRD files is fixed when they are originally
           generated, and if you change this parameter afterwards, you'll have
           to delete the old RRD files or somehow convert them.

           Example value: 5

       timeout
           Timeout in seconds for the test complete.

           Example value: 2

           Default value: 2

       This probe is somewhat unortodox, since it regards the sucessful
       retrieval of a banned webpage as a loss.
