       A probe for smokeping, which uses the ciscoRttMon MIB functionality
       ("Service Assurance Agent", "SAA") of Cisco IOS to measure TCP connect
       times between a Cisco router and a TCP server. The measured value is
       the time is the time to establish a TCP session, i.e. the time between
       the initial "SYN" TCP packet of the router and the "SYN ACK" packet of
       the host. The router terminates the TCP session immediately after the
       reception of "SYN ACK" with a "FIN" packet.

       Supported probe-specific variables:

       forks
           Run this many concurrent processes at maximum

           Example value: 5

           Default value: 5

       offset
           If you run many probes concurrently you may want to prevent them
           from hitting your network all at the same time. Using the probe-
           specific offset parameter you can change the point in time when
           each probe will be run. Offset is specified in % of total interval,
           or alternatively as 'random', and the offset from the 'General'
           section is used if nothing is specified here. Note that this does
           NOT influence the rrds itself, it is just a matter of when data
           acqusition is initiated.  (This variable is only applicable if the
           variable 'concurrentprobes' is set in the 'General' section.)

           Example value: 50%

       step
           Duration of the base interval that this probe should use, if dif-
           ferent from the one specified in the 'Database' section. Note that
           the step in the RRD files is fixed when they are originally gener-
           ated, and if you change the step parameter afterwards, you'll have
           to delete the old RRD files or somehow convert them. (This variable
           is only applicable if the variable 'concurrentprobes' is set in the
           'General' section.)

           Example value: 300

       timeout
           How long a single 'ping' takes at maximum

           Example value: 15

           Default value: 5

       Supported target-specific variables:

       ioshost
           The (mandatory) ioshost parameter specifies the Cisco router, which
           will establish the TCP connections as well as the SNMP community
           string on the router.

           Example value: RTTcommunity@Myrouter.foobar.com.au

           This setting is mandatory.

       iosint
           The (optional) iosint parameter is the source address for the TCP
           connections. This should be one of the active (!) IP addresses of
           the router to get results. IOS looks up the target host address in
           the forwarding table and then uses the interface(s) listed there to
           send the TCP packets. By default IOS uses the (primary) IP address
           on the sending interface as source address for a connection.

           Example value: 10.33.22.11

       pings
           How many pings should be sent to each target, if different from the
           global value specified in the Database section. Note that the num-
           ber of pings in the RRD files is fixed when they are originally
           generated, and if you change this parameter afterwards, you'll have
           to delete the old RRD files or somehow convert them.

           Example value: 5

       port
           The (optional) port parameter lets you configure the destination
           TCP port on the host. The default is the http port 80.

           Default value: 80

       tos The (optional) tos parameter specifies the value of the ToS byte in
           the IP header of the packets from the router. Multiply DSCP values
           times 4 and Precedence values times 32 to calculate the ToS values
           to configure, e.g. ToS 160 corresponds to a DSCP value 40 and a
           Precedence value of 5. Please note that this will not influence the
           ToS value in the packets sent by the the host.

           Example value: 160

           Default value: 0

       This probe only works with Cisco IOS 12.0(3)T or higher. It is recom-
       mended to test it on less critical routers first.

       IINNSSTTAALLLLAATTIIOONN

       To install this probe copy ciscoRttMonMIB.pm to ($SMOKEPINGIN-
       STALLDIR)/Smokeping/lib and CiscoRTTMonTcpConnect.pm to ($SMOKEPINGIN-
       STALLDIR)/lib/Smokeping/probes. V0.97 or higher of Simon Leinen's
       SNMP_Session.pm is required.

       The router(s) must be configured to allow read/write SNMP access. Suf-
       ficient is:

               snmp-server community RTTCommunity RW

       If you want to be a bit more restrictive with SNMP write access to the
       router, then consider configuring something like this

               access-list 2 permit 10.37.3.5
               snmp-server view RttMon ciscoRttMonMIB included
               snmp-server community RTTCommunity view RttMon RW 2

       The above configuration grants SNMP read-write only to 10.37.3.5 (the
       smokeping host) and only to the ciscoRttMon MIB tree. The probe does
       not need access to SNMP variables outside the RttMon tree.

       The probe establishes unnecessary connections, i.e. more than config-
       ured in the "pings" variable, because the RTTMon MIB only allows to set
       a total time for all connections in one measurement run (one "life").
       Currently the probe sets the life duration to "pings"*2+3 seconds (2
       secs is the timeout value hardcoded into this probe).
