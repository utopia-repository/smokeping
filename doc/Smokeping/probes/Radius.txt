       This probe measures RADIUS (RFC 2865) authentication
       latency for SmokePing.

       The username to be tested is specified in either the
       probe-specific or the target-specific variable `username',
       with the target-specific one overriding the probe-specific
       one.

       The password can be specified either (in order of prece-
       dence, with the latter overriding the former) in the
       probe-specific variable `password', in an external file or
       in the target-specific variable `password'.  The location
       of this file is given in the probe-specific variable
       `passwordfile'. See _S_m_o_k_e_p_i_n_g_:_:_p_r_o_b_e_s_:_:_p_a_s_s_w_o_r_d_-
       _c_h_e_c_k_e_r(3pm) for the format of this file (summary: colon-
       separated triplets of the form `<host>:<username>:<pass-
       word>')

       The RADIUS protocol requires a shared secret between the
       server and the client.  This secret can be specified
       either (in order of precedence, with the latter overriding
       the former) in the probe-specific variable `secret', in an
       external file or in the target-specific variable `secret'.
       This external file is located by the probe-specific vari-
       able `secretfile', and it should contain whitespace-sepa-
       rated pairs of the form `<host> <secret>'. Comments and
       blank lines are OK.

       If the optional probe-specific variable `nas_ip_address'
       is specified, its value is inserted into the authentica-
       tion requests as the `NAS-IP-Address' RADIUS attribute.

       The probe tries to be nice to the server and does not send
       authentication requests more frequently than once every X
       seconds, where X is the value of the target-specific
       "min_interval" variable (1 by default).

VVAARRIIAABBLLEESS
       Supported probe-specific variables:

       forks
           Run this many concurrent processes at maximum

           Example value: 5

           Default value: 5

       offset
           If you run many probes concurrently you may want to
           prevent them from hitting your network all at the same
           time. Using the probe-specific offset parameter you
           can change the point in time when each probe will be
           run. Offset is specified in % of total interval, or
           alternatively as 'random', and the offset from the
           'General' section is used if nothing is specified
           here. Note that this does NOT influence the rrds
           itself, it is just a matter of when data acqusition is
           initiated.  (This variable is only applicable if the
           variable 'concurrentprobes' is set in the 'General'
           section.)

           Example value: 50%

       passwordfile
           Location of the file containing usernames and pass-
           words.

           Example value: /some/place/secret

       secretfile
           A file containing the RADIUS shared secrets for the
           targets. It should contain whitespace-separated pairs
           of the form `<host> <secret>'. Comments and blank
           lines are OK.

           Example value: /another/place/secret

       step
           Duration of the base interval that this probe should
           use, if different from the one specified in the
           'Database' section. Note that the step in the RRD
           files is fixed when they are originally generated, and
           if you change the step parameter afterwards, you'll
           have to delete the old RRD files or somehow convert
           them. (This variable is only applicable if the vari-
           able 'concurrentprobes' is set in the 'General' sec-
           tion.)

           Example value: 300

       Supported target-specific variables:

       mininterval
           The minimum interval between each authentication
           request sent, in (possibly fractional) seconds.

           Default value: 1

       nas_ip_address
           The NAS-IP-Address RADIUS attribute for the authenti-
           cation requests. Not needed everywhere.

           Example value: 10.1.2.3

       password
           The password for the user, if not present in the pass-
           word file.

           Example value: test-password

       pings
           How many pings should be sent to each target, if dif-
           ferent from the global value specified in the Database
           section. Note that the number of pings in the RRD
           files is fixed when they are originally generated, and
           if you change this parameter afterwards, you'll have
           to delete the old RRD files or somehow convert them.

           Example value: 5

       port
           The RADIUS port to be used

           Example value: 1645

       secret
           The RADIUS shared secret for the target, if not pre-
           sent in the secrets file.

           Example value: test-secret

       timeout
           Timeout in seconds for the RADIUS queries.

           Default value: 5

       username
           The username to be tested.

           Example value: test-user

           This setting is mandatory.

       There should be a more general way of specifying RADIUS
       attributes.
