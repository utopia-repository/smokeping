       Integrates the remote execution of FPing via ssh/rsh into
       smokeping.  The variable bbiinnaarryy must point to your copy of
       the ssh/rsh program.  The variable rrbbiinnaarryy must point to
       your copy of the fping program at the remote end.

       Supported probe-specific variables:

       binary
           This variable specifies the path of the remote shell
           program (usually ssh, rsh or remsh). Any other script
           or binary that can be called as

           binary [ -l ruser ] rhost rbinary

           may be used.

           Example value: /usr/bin/ssh

           This setting is mandatory.

       hostinterval
           The fping "-p" parameter, but in (possibly fractional)
           seconds rather than milliseconds, for consistency with
           other Smokeping probes. From _f_p_i_n_g(1):

           This parameter sets the time that fping  waits between
           successive packets to an individual target.

           Example value: 1.5

       mininterval
           The fping "-i" parameter, but in (probably fractional)
           seconds rather than milliseconds, for consistency with
           other Smokeping probes. From _f_p_i_n_g(1):

           The minimum amount of time between sending a ping
           packet to any target.

           Example value: 0.001

           Default value: 0.01

       offset
           If you run many probes concurrently you may want to
           prevent them from hitting your network all at the same
           time. Using the probe-specific offset parameter you
           can change the point in time when each probe will be
           run. Offset is specified in % of total interval, or
           alternatively as 'random', and the offset from the
           'General' section is used if nothing is specified
           here. Note that this does NOT influence the rrds
           itself, it is just a matter of when data acqusition is
           initiated.  (This variable is only applicable if the
           variable 'concurrentprobes' is set in the 'General'
           section.)

           Example value: 50%

       packetsize
           The ping packet size (in the range of 12-64000 bytes).

           Example value: 5000

       pings
           How many pings should be sent to each target, if dif-
           ferent from the global value specified in the Database
           section. Note that the number of pings in the RRD
           files is fixed when they are originally generated, and
           if you change this parameter afterwards, you'll have
           to delete the old RRD files or somehow convert them.

           Example value: 20

       rbinary
           The location of your fping binary.

           Example value: /usr/bin/fping

           This setting is mandatory.

       rhost
           The rrhhoosstt option specifies the remote device from
           where fping will be launched.

           Example value: my.pinger.host

           This setting is mandatory.

       ruser
           The (optional) rruusseerr option allows you to specify the
           remote user, if different from the one running the
           smokeping daemon.

           Example value: foo

       step
           Duration of the base interval that this probe should
           use, if different from the one specified in the
           'Database' section. Note that the step in the RRD
           files is fixed when they are originally generated, and
           if you change the step parameter afterwards, you'll
           have to delete the old RRD files or somehow convert
           them. (This variable is only applicable if the vari-
           able 'concurrentprobes' is set in the 'General' sec-
           tion.)

           Example value: 300

       timeout
           The fping "-t" parameter, but in (possibly fractional)
           seconds rather than milliseconds, for consistency with
           other Smokeping probes. Note that as Smokeping uses
           the fping 'counting' mode (-C), this apparently only
           affects the last ping.

           Example value: 1.5

NNOOTTEESS
       It is important to make sure that you can access the
       remote machine without a password prompt, otherwise this
       probe will not work properly.  To test just try something
       like this:

           $ ssh foo@HostA.foobar.com fping HostB.barfoo.com

       The next thing you see must be fping's output.

       The rrhhoosstt, rruusseerr and rrbbiinnaarryy variables used to be config-
       ured in the Targets section of the first target or its
       parents They were moved to the Probes section, because the
       variables aren't really target-specific (all the targets
       are measured with the same parameters). The Targets sec-
       tions aren't recognized anymore.

BBUUGGSS
       This functionality should be in a generic 'remote execu-
       tion' module so that it could be used for the other probes
       too.
