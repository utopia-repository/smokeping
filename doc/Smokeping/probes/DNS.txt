DDEESSCCRRIIPPTTIIOONN
       Integrates dig as a probe into smokeping. The variable bbiinnaarryy must
       point to your copy of the dig program. If it is not installed on your
       system yet, you should install bind-utils >= 9.0.0.

       The Probe asks the given host n-times for it's name. Where n is the
       amount specified in the config File.

       Supported probe-specific variables:

       binary
           The location of your dig binary.

           Example value: /usr/bin/dig

           This setting is mandatory.

       forks
           Run this many concurrent processes at maximum

           Example value: 5

           Default value: 5

       offset
           If you run many probes concurrently you may want to prevent them
           from hitting your network all at the same time. Using the probe-
           specific offset parameter you can change the point in time when
           each probe will be run. Offset is specified in % of total interval,
           or alternatively as 'random', and the offset from the 'General'
           section is used if nothing is specified here. Note that this does
           NOT influence the rrds itself, it is just a matter of when data
           acqusition is initiated.  (This variable is only applicable if the
           variable 'concurrentprobes' is set in the 'General' section.)

           Example value: 50%

       step
           Duration of the base interval that this probe should use, if dif-
           ferent from the one specified in the 'Database' section. Note that
           the step in the RRD files is fixed when they are originally gener-
           ated, and if you change the step parameter afterwards, you'll have
           to delete the old RRD files or somehow convert them. (This variable
           is only applicable if the variable 'concurrentprobes' is set in the
           'General' section.)

           Example value: 300

       timeout
           How long a single 'ping' takes at maximum

           Example value: 15

           Default value: 5

       Supported target-specific variables:

       lookup
           Name of the host to look up in the dns.

           Example value: www.example.org

       pings
           How many pings should be sent to each target, if different from the
           global value specified in the Database section. Note that the num-
           ber of pings in the RRD files is fixed when they are originally
           generated, and if you change this parameter afterwards, you'll have
           to delete the old RRD files or somehow convert them.

           Example value: 5

       server
           Name of the dns server to use.

           Example value: ns1.someisp.net
