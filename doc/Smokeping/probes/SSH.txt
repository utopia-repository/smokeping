       Integrates ssh-keyscan as a probe into smokeping. The
       variable bbiinnaarryy must point to your copy of the ssh-keyscan
       program. If it is not installed on your system yet, you
       should install openssh >= 3.8p1

       The Probe asks the given host n-times for it's public key,
       where n is the amount specified in the config File.

       As part of the initialization, the probe asks localhost
       for it's public key and tries to parse the output. Make
       sure you have SSH running on the localhost as well.

       Supported probe-specific variables:

       binary
           The location of your ssh-keyscan binary.

           Example value: /usr/bin/ssh-keyscan

           This setting is mandatory.

       forks
           Run this many concurrent processes at maximum

           Example value: 5

           Default value: 5

       offset
           If you run many probes concurrently you may want to
           prevent them from hitting your network all at the same
           time. Using the probe-specific offset parameter you
           can change the point in time when each probe will be
           run. Offset is specified in % of total interval, or
           alternatively as 'random', and the offset from the
           'General' section is used if nothing is specified
           here. Note that this does NOT influence the rrds
           itself, it is just a matter of when data acqusition is
           initiated.  (This variable is only applicable if the
           variable 'concurrentprobes' is set in the 'General'
           section.)

           Example value: 50%

       step
           Duration of the base interval that this probe should
           use, if different from the one specified in the
           'Database' section. Note that the step in the RRD
           files is fixed when they are originally generated, and
           if you change the step parameter afterwards, you'll
           have to delete the old RRD files or somehow convert
           them. (This variable is only applicable if the vari-
           able 'concurrentprobes' is set in the 'General' sec-
           tion.)

           Example value: 300

       timeout
           How long a single 'ping' takes at maximum

           Example value: 15

           Default value: 5

       Supported target-specific variables:

       keytype
           Type of key, used in ssh-keyscan -t <keytype>

           Example value: dsa

           Default value: rsa

       pings
           How many pings should be sent to each target, if dif-
           ferent from the global value specified in the Database
           section. Note that the number of pings in the RRD
           files is fixed when they are originally generated, and
           if you change this parameter afterwards, you'll have
           to delete the old RRD files or somehow convert them.

           Example value: 5
