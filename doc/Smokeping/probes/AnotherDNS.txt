       Like DNS, but uses Net::DNS and Time::HiRes instead of
       dig. This probe does *not* retry the request three times
       before it is considerd "lost", like dig and other resolver
       do by default. If operating as caching Nameserver, BIND
       (and maybe others) expect clients to retry the request if
       the answer is not in the cache. So, ask the nameserver for
       something that he is authoritative for if you want measure
       the network packet loss correctly.

       If you have a really fast network and nameserver, you will
       notice that this probe reports the query time in microsec-
       ond resolution. :-)

       Supported probe-specific variables:

       forks
           Run this many concurrent processes at maximum

           Example value: 5

           Default value: 5

       offset
           If you run many probes concurrently you may want to
           prevent them from hitting your network all at the same
           time. Using the probe-specific offset parameter you
           can change the point in time when each probe will be
           run. Offset is specified in % of total interval, or
           alternatively as 'random', and the offset from the
           'General' section is used if nothing is specified
           here. Note that this does NOT influence the rrds
           itself, it is just a matter of when data acqusition is
           initiated.  (This variable is only applicable if the
           variable 'concurrentprobes' is set in the 'General'
           section.)

           Example value: 50%

       step
           Duration of the base interval that this probe should
           use, if different from the one specified in the
           'Database' section. Note that the step in the RRD
           files is fixed when they are originally generated, and
           if you change the step parameter afterwards, you'll
           have to delete the old RRD files or somehow convert
           them. (This variable is only applicable if the vari-
           able 'concurrentprobes' is set in the 'General' sec-
           tion.)

           Example value: 300

       Supported target-specific variables:

       lookup
           Name of the host to look up in the dns.

           Example value: www.example.org

       mininterval
           Minimum time between sending two lookup queries in
           (possibly fractional) seconds.

           Default value: 0.5

       pings
           How many pings should be sent to each target, if dif-
           ferent from the global value specified in the Database
           section. Note that the number of pings in the RRD
           files is fixed when they are originally generated, and
           if you change this parameter afterwards, you'll have
           to delete the old RRD files or somehow convert them.

           Example value: 5

       port
           The UDP Port to use.

           Default value: 53

       recordtype
           Record type to look up.

           Default value: A

       require_noerror
           Only Count Answers with Response Status NOERROR.

           Default value: 0

       timeout
           Timeout for a single request in seconds.

           Default value: 5
