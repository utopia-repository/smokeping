       Supported probe-specific variables:

       binary
           The location of your echoping binary.

           Default value: /usr/bin/echoping

       forks
           Run this many concurrent processes at maximum

           Example value: 5

           Default value: 5

       offset
           If you run many probes concurrently you may want to prevent them
           from hitting your network all at the same time. Using the probe-
           specific offset parameter you can change the point in time when
           each probe will be run. Offset is specified in % of total interval,
           or alternatively as 'random', and the offset from the 'General'
           section is used if nothing is specified here. Note that this does
           NOT influence the rrds itself, it is just a matter of when data
           acqusition is initiated.  (This variable is only applicable if the
           variable 'concurrentprobes' is set in the 'General' section.)

           Example value: 50%

       step
           Duration of the base interval that this probe should use, if dif-
           ferent from the one specified in the 'Database' section. Note that
           the step in the RRD files is fixed when they are originally gener-
           ated, and if you change the step parameter afterwards, you'll have
           to delete the old RRD files or somehow convert them. (This variable
           is only applicable if the variable 'concurrentprobes' is set in the
           'General' section.)

           Example value: 300

       Supported target-specific variables:

       accept_redirects
           The _e_c_h_o_p_i_n_g(1) "-R" option: Accept  HTTP  status  codes  3xx
           (redirections) as normal responses instead of treating them as
           errors. Note that this option is only available starting with
           Echoping 6.

           Enabled if the value is anything other than 'no' or '0'.

           Example value: yes

       extraopts
           Any extra options specified here will be passed unmodified to
           _e_c_h_o_p_i_n_g(1).

           Example value: -some-letter-the-author-did-not-think-of

       ignore_cache
           The _e_c_h_o_p_i_n_g(1) "-A" option: force the proxy to ignore the cache.
           Enabled if the value is anything other than 'no' or '0'.

           Example value: yes

       ipversion
           The IP protocol used. Possible values are "4" and "6".  Passed to
           _e_c_h_o_p_i_n_g(1) as the "-4" or "-6" options.

           Example value: 4

       pings
           How many pings should be sent to each target, if different from the
           global value specified in the Database section. Note that the num-
           ber of pings in the RRD files is fixed when they are originally
           generated, and if you change this parameter afterwards, you'll have
           to delete the old RRD files or somehow convert them.

           Example value: 5

       port
           The TCP port to use.

           Example value: 80

       priority
           The "-p" _e_c_h_o_p_i_n_g(1) option.

           Example value: 6

       revalidate_data
           The _e_c_h_o_p_i_n_g(1) "-a" option: force the proxy to revalidate data
           with original server. Enabled if the value is anything other than
           'no' or '0'.

           Example value: no

       timeout
           The "-t" _e_c_h_o_p_i_n_g(1) option.

           Example value: 1

           Default value: 5

       tos The "-P" _e_c_h_o_p_i_n_g(1) option.

           Example value: 0xa0

       url The URL to be requested from the web server or cache. Can be either
           relative (/...) for web servers or absolute (http://...) for
           caches.

           Default value: /

       waittime
           The "-w" _e_c_h_o_p_i_n_g(1) option.

           Example value: 1

NNOOTTEESS
       You should consider setting a lower value for the "pings" variable than
       the default 20, as repetitive URL fetching may be quite heavy on the
       server.
