DDEESSCCRRIIPPTTIIOONN
       A probe for smokeping, which uses the ciscoRttMon MIB functionality
       ("Service Assurance Agent", "SAA") of Cisco IOS to measure ICMP echo
       ("ping") roundtrip times between a Cisco router and any IP address.

       Supported probe-specific variables:

       forks
           Run this many concurrent processes at maximum

           Example value: 5

           Default value: 5

       offset
           If you run many probes concurrently you may want to prevent them
           from hitting your network all at the same time. Using the probe-
           specific offset parameter you can change the point in time when
           each probe will be run. Offset is specified in % of total interval,
           or alternatively as 'random', and the offset from the 'General'
           section is used if nothing is specified here. Note that this does
           NOT influence the rrds itself, it is just a matter of when data
           acqusition is initiated.  (This variable is only applicable if the
           variable 'concurrentprobes' is set in the 'General' section.)

           Example value: 50%

       step
           Duration of the base interval that this probe should use, if dif-
           ferent from the one specified in the 'Database' section. Note that
           the step in the RRD files is fixed when they are originally gener-
           ated, and if you change the step parameter afterwards, you'll have
           to delete the old RRD files or somehow convert them. (This variable
           is only applicable if the variable 'concurrentprobes' is set in the
           'General' section.)

           Example value: 300

       timeout
           How long a single 'ping' takes at maximum

           Example value: 15

           Default value: 5

       Supported target-specific variables:

       ioshost
           The (mandatory) ioshost parameter specifies the Cisco router, which
           will execute the pings, as well as the SNMP community string on the
           router.

           Example value: RTTcommunity@Myrouter.foobar.com.au

           This setting is mandatory.

       iosint
           The (optional) iosint parameter is the source address for the pings
           sent. This should be one of the active (!) IP addresses of the
           router to get results. IOS looks up the target host address in the
           forwarding table and then uses the interface(s) listed there to
           send the ping packets. By default IOS uses the (primary) IP address
           on the sending interface as source address for a ping. The RTTMon
           MIB versions before IOS 12.0(3)T didn't support this parameter.

           Example value: 10.33.22.11

       packetsize
           The packetsize parameter lets you configure the packetsize for the
           pings sent. The minimum is 8, the maximum 16392. Use the same num-
           ber as with fping, if you want the same packet sizes being used on
           the network.

           Default value: 56

       pings
           How many pings should be sent to each target, if different from the
           global value specified in the Database section. Note that the num-
           ber of pings in the RRD files is fixed when they are originally
           generated, and if you change this parameter afterwards, you'll have
           to delete the old RRD files or somehow convert them.

           Example value: 5

       tos The (optional) tos parameter specifies the value of the ToS byte in
           the IP header of the pings. Multiply DSCP values times 4 and Prece-
           dence values times 32 to calculate the ToS values to configure,
           e.g. ToS 160 corresponds to a DSCP value 40 and a Precedence value
           of 5. The RTTMon MIB versions before IOS 12.0(3)T didn't support
           this parameter.

           Example value: 160

           Default value: 0

       vrf The the VPN name in which the RTT operation will be used. For regu-
           lar RTT operation this field should not be configured. The agent
           will use this field to identify the VPN routing Table for this
           operation.

           Example value: INTERNET

       It is highly recommended to use this probe with routers running IOS
       12.0(3)T or higher and to test it on less critical routers first. I
       managed to crash a router with 12.0(9) quite consistently ( in IOS
       lingo 12.0(9) is older code than 12.0(3)T ). I did not observe crashes
       on higher IOS releases, but messages on the router like the one below,
       when multiple processes concurrently accessed the same router (this
       case was IOS 12.1(12b) ):

       Aug 20 07:30:14: %RTT-3-SemaphoreBadUnlock: %RTR: Attempt to unlock
       semaphore by wrong RTR process 70, locked by 78

       Aug 20 07:35:15: %RTT-3-SemaphoreInUse: %RTR: Could not obtain a lock
       for RTR. Process 80

       To install this probe copy ciscoRttMonMIB.pm files to ($SMOKEPINGIN-
       STALLDIR)/lib/Smokeping and CiscoRTTMonEchoICMP.pm to ($SMOKEPINGIN-
       STALLDIR)/lib/Smokeping/probes. V0.97 or higher of Simon Leinen's
       SNMP_Session.pm is required.

       The router(s) must be configured to allow read/write SNMP access. Suf-
       ficient is:

               snmp-server community RTTCommunity RW

       If you want to be a bit more restrictive with SNMP write access to the
       router, then consider configuring something like this

               access-list 2 permit 10.37.3.5
               snmp-server view RttMon ciscoRttMonMIB included
               snmp-server community RTTCommunity view RttMon RW 2

       The above configuration grants SNMP read-write only to 10.37.3.5 (the
       smokeping host) and only to the ciscoRttMon MIB tree. The probe does
       not need access to SNMP variables outside the RttMon tree.

BBUUGGSS
       The probe sends unnecessary pings, i.e. more than configured in the
       "pings" variable, because the RTTMon MIB only allows to set a total
       time for all pings in one measurement run (one "life"). Currently the
       probe sets the life duration to "pings"*2+3 seconds (2 secs is the ping
       timeout value hardcoded into this probe).
