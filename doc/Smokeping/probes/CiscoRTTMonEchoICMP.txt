DDEESSCCRRIIPPTTIIOONN
       A probe for smokeping, which uses the ciscoRttMon MIB
       functionality ("Service Assurance Agent", "SAA") of Cisco
       IOS to measure ICMP echo ("ping") roundtrip times between
       a Cisco router and any IP address.

       Supported probe-specific variables:

       forks
           Run this many concurrent processes at maximum

           Example value: 5

           Default value: 5

       offset
           If you run many probes concurrently you may want to
           prevent them from hitting your network all at the same
           time. Using the probe-specific offset parameter you
           can change the point in time when each probe will be
           run. Offset is specified in % of total interval, or
           alternatively as 'random', and the offset from the
           'General' section is used if nothing is specified
           here. Note that this does NOT influence the rrds
           itself, it is just a matter of when data acqusition is
           initiated.  (This variable is only applicable if the
           variable 'concurrentprobes' is set in the 'General'
           section.)

           Example value: 50%

       step
           Duration of the base interval that this probe should
           use, if different from the one specified in the
           'Database' section. Note that the step in the RRD
           files is fixed when they are originally generated, and
           if you change the step parameter afterwards, you'll
           have to delete the old RRD files or somehow convert
           them. (This variable is only applicable if the vari-
           able 'concurrentprobes' is set in the 'General' sec-
           tion.)

           Example value: 300

       timeout
           How long a single 'ping' takes at maximum

           Example value: 15

           Default value: 5

       Supported target-specific variables:

       ioshost
           The (mandatory) ioshost parameter specifies the Cisco
           router, which will execute the pings, as well as the
           SNMP community string on the router.

           Example value: RTTcommunity@Myrouter.foobar.com.au

           This setting is mandatory.

       iosint
           The (optional) iosint parameter is the source address
           for the pings sent. This should be one of the active
           (!) IP addresses of the router to get results. IOS
           looks up the target host address in the forwarding
           table and then uses the interface(s) listed there to
           send the ping packets. By default IOS uses the (pri-
           mary) IP address on the sending interface as source
           address for a ping. The RTTMon MIB versions before IOS
           12.0(3)T didn't support this parameter.

           Example value: 10.33.22.11

       packetsize
           The packetsize parameter lets you configure the pack-
           etsize for the pings sent. The minimum is 8, the maxi-
           mum 16392. Use the same number as with fping, if you
           want the same packet sizes being used on the network.

           Default value: 56

       pings
           How many pings should be sent to each target, if dif-
           ferent from the global value specified in the Database
           section. Note that the number of pings in the RRD
           files is fixed when they are originally generated, and
           if you change this parameter afterwards, you'll have
           to delete the old RRD files or somehow convert them.

           Example value: 5

       tos The (optional) tos parameter specifies the value of
           the ToS byte in the IP header of the pings. Multiply
           DSCP values times 4 and Precedence values times 32 to
           calculate the ToS values to configure, e.g. ToS 160
           corresponds to a DSCP value 40 and a Precedence value
           of 5. The RTTMon MIB versions before IOS 12.0(3)T
           didn't support this parameter.

           Example value: 160

           Default value: 0

       It is highly recommended to use this probe with routers
       running IOS 12.0(3)T or higher and to test it on less
       critical routers first. I managed to crash a router with
       12.0(9) quite consistently ( in IOS lingo 12.0(9) is older
       code than 12.0(3)T ). I did not observe crashes on higher
       IOS releases, but messages on the router like the one
       below, when multiple processes concurrently accessed the
       same router (this case was IOS 12.1(12b) ):

       Aug 20 07:30:14: %RTT-3-SemaphoreBadUnlock: %RTR: Attempt
       to unlock semaphore by wrong RTR process 70, locked by 78

       Aug 20 07:35:15: %RTT-3-SemaphoreInUse: %RTR: Could not
       obtain a lock for RTR. Process 80

       To install this probe copy ciscoRttMonMIB.pm files to
       ($SMOKEPINGINSTALLDIR)/lib/Smokeping and CiscoRTTMonE-
       choICMP.pm to ($SMOKEPINGINSTALLDIR)/lib/Smokeping/probes.
       V0.97 or higher of Simon Leinen's SNMP_Session.pm is
       required.

       The router(s) must be configured to allow read/write SNMP
       access. Sufficient is:

               snmp-server community RTTCommunity RW

       If you want to be a bit more restrictive with SNMP write
       access to the router, then consider configuring something
       like this

               access-list 2 permit 10.37.3.5
               snmp-server view RttMon ciscoRttMonMIB included
               snmp-server community RTTCommunity view RttMon RW 2

       The above configuration grants SNMP read-write only to
       10.37.3.5 (the smokeping host) and only to the ciscoRttMon
       MIB tree. The probe does not need access to SNMP variables
       outside the RttMon tree.

BBUUGGSS
       The probe sends unnecessary pings, i.e. more than config-
       ured in the "pings" variable, because the RTTMon MIB only
       allows to set a total time for all pings in one measure-
       ment run (one "life"). Currently the probe sets the life
       duration to "pings"*2+3 seconds (2 secs is the ping time-
       out value hardcoded into this probe).
