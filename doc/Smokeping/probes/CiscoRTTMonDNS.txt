       A probe for smokeping, which uses the ciscoRttMon MIB functionality
       ("Service Assurance Agent", "SAA") of Cisco IOS to time ( recursive,
       type A) DNS queries to a DNS server.

       Supported probe-specific variables:

       forks
           Run this many concurrent processes at maximum

           Example value: 5

           Default value: 5

       offset
           If you run many probes concurrently you may want to prevent them
           from hitting your network all at the same time. Using the probe-
           specific offset parameter you can change the point in time when
           each probe will be run. Offset is specified in % of total interval,
           or alternatively as 'random', and the offset from the 'General'
           section is used if nothing is specified here. Note that this does
           NOT influence the rrds itself, it is just a matter of when data
           acqusition is initiated.  (This variable is only applicable if the
           variable 'concurrentprobes' is set in the 'General' section.)

           Example value: 50%

       step
           Duration of the base interval that this probe should use, if dif-
           ferent from the one specified in the 'Database' section. Note that
           the step in the RRD files is fixed when they are originally gener-
           ated, and if you change the step parameter afterwards, you'll have
           to delete the old RRD files or somehow convert them. (This variable
           is only applicable if the variable 'concurrentprobes' is set in the
           'General' section.)

           Example value: 300

       timeout
           How long a single 'ping' takes at maximum

           Example value: 15

           Default value: 5

       Supported target-specific variables:

       ioshost
           The (mandatory) ioshost parameter specifies the Cisco router, which
           will send the DNS requests, as well as the SNMP community string on
           the router.

           Example value: RTTcommunity@Myrouter.foobar.com.au

           This setting is mandatory.

       iosint
           The (optional) iosint parameter is the source address for the DNS
           packets.  This should be one of the active (!) IP addresses of the
           router to get results. IOS looks up the target host address in the
           forwarding table and then uses the interface(s) listed there to
           send the DNS packets. By default IOS uses the (primary) IP address
           on the sending interface as source address for packets originated
           by the router.

           Example value: 10.33.22.11

       name
           The (mandatory) name parameter is the DNS name to resolve.

           Example value: www.foobar.com.au

           This setting is mandatory.

       pings
           How many pings should be sent to each target, if different from the
           global value specified in the Database section. Note that the num-
           ber of pings in the RRD files is fixed when they are originally
           generated, and if you change this parameter afterwards, you'll have
           to delete the old RRD files or somehow convert them.

           Example value: 5

       The host parameter specifies the DNS server, which the router will use.

       This probe only works with IOS 12.0(3)T or higher.  It is recommended
       to test it on less critical routers first.

       To install this probe copy ciscoRttMonMIB.pm to ($SMOKEPINGIN-
       STALLDIR)/lib/Smokeping and CiscoRTTMonDNS.pm to ($SMOKEPINGIN-
       STALLDIR)/lib/Smokeping/probes.

       The router(s) must be configured to allow read/write SNMP access. Suf-
       ficient is:

               snmp-server community RTTCommunity RW

       If you want to be a bit more restrictive with SNMP write access to the
       router, then consider configuring something like this

               access-list 2 permit 10.37.3.5
               snmp-server view RttMon ciscoRttMonMIB included
               snmp-server community RTTCommunity view RttMon RW 2

       The above configuration grants SNMP read-write only to 10.37.3.5 (the
       smokeping host) and only to the ciscoRttMon MIB tree. The probe does
       not need access to SNMP variables outside the RttMon tree.

       The probe does unnecessary DNS queries, i.e. more than configured in
       the "pings" variable, because the RTTMon MIB only allows to set a total
       time for all queries in one measurement run (one "life"). Currently the
       probe sets the life duration to "pings"*2+3 seconds (2 secs is the
       timeout value hardcoded into this probe).
