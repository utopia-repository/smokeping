       Smokeping::probes::EchoPing - an echoping(1) probe for
       SmokePing

OOVVEERRVVIIEEWW
       Measures TCP or UDP echo (port 7) roundtrip times for
       SmokePing. Can also be used as a base class for other
       _e_c_h_o_p_i_n_g(1) probes.

       Supported probe-specific variables:

       binary
           The location of your echoping binary.

           Default value: /usr/bin/echoping

       forks
           Run this many concurrent processes at maximum

           Example value: 5

           Default value: 5

       offset
           If you run many probes concurrently you may want to
           prevent them from hitting your network all at the same
           time. Using the probe-specific offset parameter you
           can change the point in time when each probe will be
           run. Offset is specified in % of total interval, or
           alternatively as 'random', and the offset from the
           'General' section is used if nothing is specified
           here. Note that this does NOT influence the rrds
           itself, it is just a matter of when data acqusition is
           initiated.  (This variable is only applicable if the
           variable 'concurrentprobes' is set in the 'General'
           section.)

           Example value: 50%

       step
           Duration of the base interval that this probe should
           use, if different from the one specified in the
           'Database' section. Note that the step in the RRD
           files is fixed when they are originally generated, and
           if you change the step parameter afterwards, you'll
           have to delete the old RRD files or somehow convert
           them. (This variable is only applicable if the vari-
           able 'concurrentprobes' is set in the 'General' sec-
           tion.)

           Example value: 300

       Supported target-specific variables:

       extraopts
           Any extra options specified here will be passed unmod-
           ified to _e_c_h_o_p_i_n_g(1).

           Example value: -some-let-
           ter-the-author-did-not-think-of

       fill
           The "-f" _e_c_h_o_p_i_n_g(1) option.

           Example value: A

       ipversion
           The IP protocol used. Possible values are "4" and "6".
           Passed to _e_c_h_o_p_i_n_g(1) as the "-4" or "-6" options.

           Example value: 4

       pings
           How many pings should be sent to each target, if dif-
           ferent from the global value specified in the Database
           section. Note that the number of pings in the RRD
           files is fixed when they are originally generated, and
           if you change this parameter afterwards, you'll have
           to delete the old RRD files or somehow convert them.

           Example value: 5

       priority
           The "-p" _e_c_h_o_p_i_n_g(1) option.

           Example value: 6

       size
           The "-s" _e_c_h_o_p_i_n_g(1) option.

           Example value: 510

       timeout
           The "-t" _e_c_h_o_p_i_n_g(1) option.

           Example value: 1

           Default value: 5

       tos The "-P" _e_c_h_o_p_i_n_g(1) option.

           Example value: 0xa0

       udp The "-u" _e_c_h_o_p_i_n_g(1) option. Values other than '0' and
           'no' enable UDP.

           Example value: no

       waittime
           The "-w" _e_c_h_o_p_i_n_g(1) option.

           Example value: 1

       Should we test the availability of the service at startup?
       After that it's too late to complain.

       The location of the echoping binary should probably be a
       global variable instead of a probe-specific one. As things
       are, every EchoPing -derived probe has to declare it if
       the default (/usr/bin/echoping) isn't correct.
