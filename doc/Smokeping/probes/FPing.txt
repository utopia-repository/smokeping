       Integrates FPing as a probe into smokeping. The variable bbiinnaarryy must
       point to your copy of the FPing program.  If it is not installed on
       your system yet, you can get it from <http://www.fping.com/>.

       The (optional) ppaacckkeettssiizzee option lets you configure the packetsize for
       the pings sent.

       The FPing manpage has the following to say on this topic:

       Number of bytes of ping data to send.  The minimum size (normally 12)
       allows room for the data that fping needs to do its work (sequence num-
       ber, timestamp).  The reported received data size includes the IP
       header (normally 20 bytes) and ICMP header (8 bytes), so the minimum
       total size is 40 bytes.  Default is 56, as in ping. Maximum is the the-
       oretical maximum IP datagram size (64K), though most systems limit this
       to a smaller, system-dependent number.

VVAARRIIAABBLLEESS
       Supported probe-specific variables:

       binary
           The location of your fping binary.

           Example value: /usr/bin/fping

           This setting is mandatory.

       hostinterval
           The fping "-p" parameter, but in (possibly fractional) seconds
           rather than milliseconds, for consistency with other Smokeping
           probes. From _f_p_i_n_g(1):

           This parameter sets the time that fping  waits between successive
           packets to an individual target.

           Example value: 1.5

       mininterval
           The fping "-i" parameter, but in (probably fractional) seconds
           rather than milliseconds, for consistency with other Smokeping
           probes. From _f_p_i_n_g(1):

           The minimum amount of time between sending a ping packet to any
           target.

           Example value: 0.001

           Default value: 0.01

       offset
           If you run many probes concurrently you may want to prevent them
           from hitting your network all at the same time. Using the probe-
           specific offset parameter you can change the point in time when
           each probe will be run. Offset is specified in % of total interval,
           or alternatively as 'random', and the offset from the 'General'
           section is used if nothing is specified here. Note that this does
           NOT influence the rrds itself, it is just a matter of when data
           acqusition is initiated.  (This variable is only applicable if the
           variable 'concurrentprobes' is set in the 'General' section.)

           Example value: 50%

       packetsize
           The ping packet size (in the range of 12-64000 bytes).

           Example value: 5000

       pings
           How many pings should be sent to each target, if different from the
           global value specified in the Database section. Note that the num-
           ber of pings in the RRD files is fixed when they are originally
           generated, and if you change this parameter afterwards, you'll have
           to delete the old RRD files or somehow convert them.

           Example value: 20

       sourceaddress
           The fping "-S" parameter . From _f_p_i_n_g(1):

           Set source address.

           Example value: 192.168.0.1

       step
           Duration of the base interval that this probe should use, if dif-
           ferent from the one specified in the 'Database' section. Note that
           the step in the RRD files is fixed when they are originally gener-
           ated, and if you change the step parameter afterwards, you'll have
           to delete the old RRD files or somehow convert them. (This variable
           is only applicable if the variable 'concurrentprobes' is set in the
           'General' section.)

           Example value: 300

       timeout
           The fping "-t" parameter, but in (possibly fractional) seconds
           rather than milliseconds, for consistency with other Smokeping
           probes. Note that as Smokeping uses the fping 'counting' mode (-C),
           this apparently only affects the last ping.

           Example value: 1.5
