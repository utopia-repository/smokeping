       other Host, so get permission from the owner first!

       Supported probe-specific variables:

       forks
           Run this many concurrent processes at maximum

           Example value: 5

           Default value: 5

       offset
           If you run many probes concurrently you may want to prevent them
           from hitting your network all at the same time. Using the probe-
           specific offset parameter you can change the point in time when
           each probe will be run. Offset is specified in % of total interval,
           or alternatively as 'random', and the offset from the 'General'
           section is used if nothing is specified here. Note that this does
           NOT influence the rrds itself, it is just a matter of when data
           acqusition is initiated.  (This variable is only applicable if the
           variable 'concurrentprobes' is set in the 'General' section.)

           Example value: 50%

       step
           Duration of the base interval that this probe should use, if dif-
           ferent from the one specified in the 'Database' section. Note that
           the step in the RRD files is fixed when they are originally gener-
           ated, and if you change the step parameter afterwards, you'll have
           to delete the old RRD files or somehow convert them. (This variable
           is only applicable if the variable 'concurrentprobes' is set in the
           'General' section.)

           Example value: 300

       Supported target-specific variables:

       greeting
           Greeting string to send to the SSH Server. This will appear in the
           Logfile.  Use this to make clear, who you are and what you are
           doing to avoid confusion.

           Also, don't use something that is a valid version string. This
           probe assumes that the connection gets terminated because of proto-
           col mismatch.

           Default value: SSH-Latency-Measurement-Sorry-for-this-logmessage

       interval
           The interval to be measured. One of:

           connect
               Interval between _c_o_n_n_e_c_t_(_) and the greeting string from the
               host.

           established
               Interval between our greeting message and the end of the con-
               nection because of Protocol mismatch. This is the default.

           complete
               From _c_o_n_n_e_c_t_(_) to the end of the connection.

           Default value: established

       mininterval
           Minimum interval between the start of two connection attempts in
           (possibly fractional) seconds.

           Default value: 0.5

       pings
           How many pings should be sent to each target, if different from the
           global value specified in the Database section. Note that the num-
           ber of pings in the RRD files is fixed when they are originally
           generated, and if you change this parameter afterwards, you'll have
           to delete the old RRD files or somehow convert them.

           Example value: 5

       port
           Connect to this port.

           Default value: 22

       timeout
           Timeout for the connection.

           Default value: 5
