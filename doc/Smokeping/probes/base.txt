       Smokeping::probes::base - Base Class for implementing
       SmokePing Probes

OOVVEERRVVIIEEWW
       For the time being, please use the
       Smokeping::probes::FPing for inspiration when implementing
       your own probes.

       Supported probe-specific variables:

       offset
           If you run many probes concurrently you may want to
           prevent them from hitting your network all at the same
           time. Using the probe-specific offset parameter you
           can change the point in time when each probe will be
           run. Offset is specified in % of total interval, or
           alternatively as 'random', and the offset from the
           'General' section is used if nothing is specified
           here. Note that this does NOT influence the rrds
           itself, it is just a matter of when data acqusition is
           initiated.  (This variable is only applicable if the
           variable 'concurrentprobes' is set in the 'General'
           section.)

           Example value: 50%

       pings
           How many pings should be sent to each target, if dif-
           ferent from the global value specified in the Database
           section. Note that the number of pings in the RRD
           files is fixed when they are originally generated, and
           if you change this parameter afterwards, you'll have
           to delete the old RRD files or somehow convert them.

           Example value: 20

       step
           Duration of the base interval that this probe should
           use, if different from the one specified in the
           'Database' section. Note that the step in the RRD
           files is fixed when they are originally generated, and
           if you change the step parameter afterwards, you'll
           have to delete the old RRD files or somehow convert
           them. (This variable is only applicable if the vari-
           able 'concurrentprobes' is set in the 'General' sec-
           tion.)

           Example value: 300
