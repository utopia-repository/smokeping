       This probe measures LDAP query latency for SmokePing.  The
       query is specified by the target-specific variable `fil-
       ter' and, optionally, by the target-specific variable
       `base'. The attributes queried can be specified in the
       comma-separated list `attrs'.

       The TCP port of the LDAP server and the LDAP version to be
       used can be specified by the variables `port' and `ver-
       sion'.

       The probe can issue the starttls command to convert the
       connection into encrypted mode, if so instructed by the
       `start_tls' variable.  This requires the 'IO::Socket::SSL'
       perl module to be installed.

       The probe can also optionally do an authenticated LDAP
       bind, if the `binddn' variable is present. The password to
       be used can be specified by the target-specific variable
       `password' or in an external file.  The location of this
       file is given in the probe-specific variable `password-
       file'. See _S_m_o_k_e_p_i_n_g_:_:_p_r_o_b_e_s_:_:_p_a_s_s_w_o_r_d_c_h_e_c_k_e_r(3pm) for the
       format of this file (summary: colon-separated triplets of
       the form `<host>:<bind-dn>:<password>')

       The probe tries to be nice to the server and does not send
       authentication requests more frequently than once every X
       seconds, where X is the value of the target-specific
       "min_interval" variable (1 by default).

       Supported probe-specific variables:

       forks
           Run this many concurrent processes at maximum

           Example value: 5

           Default value: 5

       offset
           If you run many probes concurrently you may want to
           prevent them from hitting your network all at the same
           time. Using the probe-specific offset parameter you
           can change the point in time when each probe will be
           run. Offset is specified in % of total interval, or
           alternatively as 'random', and the offset from the
           'General' section is used if nothing is specified
           here. Note that this does NOT influence the rrds
           itself, it is just a matter of when data acqusition is
           initiated.  (This variable is only applicable if the
           variable 'concurrentprobes' is set in the 'General'
           section.)

           Example value: 50%

       passwordfile
           Location of the file containing usernames and pass-
           words.

           Example value: /some/place/secret

       step
           Duration of the base interval that this probe should
           use, if different from the one specified in the
           'Database' section. Note that the step in the RRD
           files is fixed when they are originally generated, and
           if you change the step parameter afterwards, you'll
           have to delete the old RRD files or somehow convert
           them. (This variable is only applicable if the vari-
           able 'concurrentprobes' is set in the 'General' sec-
           tion.)

           Example value: 300

       Supported target-specific variables:

       attrs
           The attributes queried.

           Example value: uid,someotherattr

       base
           The base to be used in the LDAP query

           Example value: dc=foo,dc=bar

       binddn
           If present, authenticate the LDAP bind with this DN.

           Example value: uid=testuser,dc=foo,dc=bar

       filter
           The actual search to be made

           Example value: uid=testuser

           This setting is mandatory.

       mininterval
           The minimum interval between each query sent, in (pos-
           sibly fractional) second s.

           Default value: 1

       password
           The password to be used, if not present in <password-
           file>.

           Example value: mypass

       pings
           How many pings should be sent to each target, if dif-
           ferent from the global value specified in the Database
           section. Note that the number of pings in the RRD
           files is fixed when they are originally generated, and
           if you change this parameter afterwards, you'll have
           to delete the old RRD files or somehow convert them.

           Example value: 5

       port
           TCP port of the LDAP server

           Example value: 389

       start_tls
           If true, encrypt the connection with the starttls com-
           mand. Disabled by default.

           Example value: 1

       timeout
           LDAP query timeout in seconds.

           Example value: 10

           Default value: 5

       version
           The LDAP version to be used.

           Example value: 3

       There should be a way of specifying TLS options, such as
       the certificates involved etc.

       The probe has an ugly way of working around the fact that
       the IO::Socket::SSL class complains if _s_t_a_r_t___t_l_s_(_) is done
       more than once in the same program. But It Works For Me
       (tm).
