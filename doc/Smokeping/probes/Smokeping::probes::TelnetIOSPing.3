.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
Integrates Cisco \s-1IOS\s0 as a probe into smokeping.  Uses the telnet protocol 
to run a ping from an \s-1IOS\s0 device (source) to another device (host).
This probe basically uses the \*(L"extended ping\*(R" of the Cisco \s-1IOS\s0.  You have
the option to specify which interface the ping is sourced from as well.
.SH "VARIABLES"
.IX Header "VARIABLES"
Supported probe-specific variables:
.IP "forks" 4
.IX Item "forks"
Run this many concurrent processes at maximum
.Sp
Example value: 5
.Sp
Default value: 5
.IP "offset" 4
.IX Item "offset"
If you run many probes concurrently you may want to prevent them from
hitting your network all at the same time. Using the probe-specific
offset parameter you can change the point in time when each probe will
be run. Offset is specified in % of total interval, or alternatively as
\&'random', and the offset from the 'General' section is used if nothing
is specified here. Note that this does \s-1NOT\s0 influence the rrds itself,
it is just a matter of when data acqusition is initiated.
(This variable is only applicable if the variable 'concurrentprobes' is set
in the 'General' section.)
.Sp
Example value: 50%
.IP "packetsize" 4
.IX Item "packetsize"
The (optional) packetsize option lets you configure the packetsize for
the pings sent.
.Sp
Default value: 56
.IP "step" 4
.IX Item "step"
Duration of the base interval that this probe should use, if different
from the one specified in the 'Database' section. Note that the step in
the \s-1RRD\s0 files is fixed when they are originally generated, and if you
change the step parameter afterwards, you'll have to delete the old \s-1RRD\s0
files or somehow convert them. (This variable is only applicable if
the variable 'concurrentprobes' is set in the 'General' section.)
.Sp
Example value: 300
.IP "timeout" 4
.IX Item "timeout"
How long a single 'ping' takes at maximum
.Sp
Example value: 15
.Sp
Default value: 5
.PP
Supported target-specific variables:
.IP "iospass" 4
.IX Item "iospass"
The iospass option allows you to specify the password for the username
specified with the option iosuser.
.Sp
Example value: password
.Sp
This setting is mandatory.
.IP "iosuser" 4
.IX Item "iosuser"
The iosuser option allows you to specify a username that has ping
capability on the \s-1IOS\s0 Device.
.Sp
Example value: user
.Sp
This setting is mandatory.
.IP "pings" 4
.IX Item "pings"
How many pings should be sent to each target, if different from the global
value specified in the Database section. Note that the number of pings in
the \s-1RRD\s0 files is fixed when they are originally generated, and if you
change this parameter afterwards, you'll have to delete the old \s-1RRD\s0
files or somehow convert them.
.Sp
Example value: 5
.IP "psource" 4
.IX Item "psource"
The (optional) psource option specifies an alternate \s-1IP\s0 address or
Interface from which you wish to source your pings from.  Routers
can have many many \s-1IP\s0 addresses, and interfaces.  When you ping from a
router you have the ability to choose which interface and/or which \s-1IP\s0
address the ping is sourced from.  Specifying an IP/interface does not 
necessarily specify the interface from which the ping will leave, but
will specify which address the packet(s) appear to come from.  If this
option is left out the \s-1IOS\s0 Device will source the packet automatically
based on routing and/or metrics.  If this doesn't make sense to you
then just leave it out.
.Sp
Example value: 192.168.2.129
.IP "source" 4
.IX Item "source"
The source option specifies the \s-1IOS\s0 device to which we telnet.  This
is an \s-1IP\s0 address of an \s-1IOS\s0 Device that you/your server:
	1)  Have the ability to telnet to
	2)  Have a valid username and password for
.Sp
Example value: 192.168.2.1
.Sp
This setting is mandatory.

.SH "NOTES"
.IX Header "NOTES"
.Sh "\s-1IOS\s0 configuration"
.IX Subsection "IOS configuration"
The \s-1IOS\s0 device should have a username/password configured, as well as
the ability to connect to the \s-1VTY\s0(s).
eg:
.PP
.Vb 7
\&    !
\&    username smokeping privilege 5 password 0 SmokepingPassword
\&    !
\&    line vty 0 4
\&     login local
\&     transport input telnet
\&    !
.Ve
.PP
Some \s-1IOS\s0 devices have a maximum of 5 VTYs available, so be careful not
to hit a limit with the 'forks' variable.
.Sh "Requirements"
.IX Subsection "Requirements"
This module requires the Net::Telnet module for perl.  This is usually
included on most newer OSs which include perl.
.Sh "Debugging"
.IX Subsection "Debugging"
There is some \s-1VERY\s0 rudimentary debugging code built into this module (it's
based on the debugging code written into Net::Telnet).  It will log
information into three files \*(L"TIPreturn\*(R", \*(L"TIPoutlog\*(R", and \*(L"TIPdump\*(R".
These files will be written out into your current working directory (\s-1CWD\s0).
You can change the names of these files to something with more meaning to
you.
.Sh "Password authentication"
.IX Subsection "Password authentication"
You should be advised that the authentication method of telnet uses
clear text transmissions...meaning that without proper network security
measures someone could sniff your username and password off the network.
I may attempt to incorporate \s-1SSH\s0 in a future version of this module, but
it is very doubtful.  Right now \s-1SSH\s0 adds a \s-1LOT\s0 of processing overhead to
a router, and isn't incredibly easy to implement in perl.
.PP
Having said this, don't be too scared of telnet.  Remember, the
original IOSPing module used \s-1RSH\s0, which is even more scary to use from
a security perspective.
.Sh "Ping packet size"
.IX Subsection "Ping packet size"
The FPing manpage has the following to say on the topic of ping packet
size:
.PP
Number of bytes of ping data to send.  The minimum size (normally 12)
allows room for the data that fping needs to do its work (sequence
number, timestamp).  The reported received data size includes the \s-1IP\s0
header (normally 20 bytes) and \s-1ICMP\s0 header (8 bytes), so the minimum
total size is 40 bytes.  Default is 56, as in ping. Maximum is the
theoretical maximum \s-1IP\s0 datagram size (64K), though most systems limit
this to a smaller, system-dependent number.
