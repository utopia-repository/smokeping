       Integrates FPing6 as a probe into smokeping. This probe is
       derived from FPing; the only difference is that the target
       host used for checking the fping command output is ::1
       instead of localhost.

       Supported probe-specific variables:

       binary
           The location of your fping binary.

           Example value: /usr/bin/fping6

           This setting is mandatory.

       hostinterval
           The fping "-p" parameter, but in (possibly fractional)
           seconds rather than milliseconds, for consistency with
           other Smokeping probes. From _f_p_i_n_g(1):

           This parameter sets the time that fping  waits between
           successive packets to an individual target.

           Example value: 1.5

       mininterval
           The fping "-i" parameter, but in (probably fractional)
           seconds rather than milliseconds, for consistency with
           other Smokeping probes. From _f_p_i_n_g(1):

           The minimum amount of time between sending a ping
           packet to any target.

           Example value: 0.001

           Default value: 0.01

       offset
           If you run many probes concurrently you may want to
           prevent them from hitting your network all at the same
           time. Using the probe-specific offset parameter you
           can change the point in time when each probe will be
           run. Offset is specified in % of total interval, or
           alternatively as 'random', and the offset from the
           'General' section is used if nothing is specified
           here. Note that this does NOT influence the rrds
           itself, it is just a matter of when data acqusition is
           initiated.  (This variable is only applicable if the
           variable 'concurrentprobes' is set in the 'General'
           section.)

           Example value: 50%

       packetsize
           The ping packet size (in the range of 12-64000 bytes).

           Example value: 5000

       pings
           How many pings should be sent to each target, if dif-
           ferent from the global value specified in the Database
           section. Note that the number of pings in the RRD
           files is fixed when they are originally generated, and
           if you change this parameter afterwards, you'll have
           to delete the old RRD files or somehow convert them.

           Example value: 20

       step
           Duration of the base interval that this probe should
           use, if different from the one specified in the
           'Database' section. Note that the step in the RRD
           files is fixed when they are originally generated, and
           if you change the step parameter afterwards, you'll
           have to delete the old RRD files or somehow convert
           them. (This variable is only applicable if the vari-
           able 'concurrentprobes' is set in the 'General' sec-
           tion.)

           Example value: 300

       timeout
           The fping "-t" parameter, but in (possibly fractional)
           seconds rather than milliseconds, for consistency with
           other Smokeping probes. From _f_p_i_n_g(1):

           Initial target timeout. In the default mode, this is
           the  amount  of  time  that ping waits for a response
           to its first request.  Successive timeouts are multi-
           plied by the backoff factor.

           Example value: 1.5
