       This probe measures TacacsPlus authentication latency for SmokePing.

       The username to be tested is specified in either the probe-specific or
       the target-specific variable `username', with the target-specific one
       overriding the probe-specific one.

       The password can be specified either (in order of precedence, with the
       latter overriding the former) in the probe-specific variable `pass-
       word', in an external file or in the target-specific variable `pass-
       word'.  The location of this file is given in the probe-specific vari-
       able `passwordfile'. See _S_m_o_k_e_p_i_n_g_:_:_p_r_o_b_e_s_:_:_p_a_s_s_w_o_r_d_c_h_e_c_k_e_r(3pm) for
       the format of this file (summary: colon-separated triplets of the form
       `<host>:<username>:<password>')

       The TacacsPlus protocol requires a shared secret between the server and
       the client.  This secret can be specified either (in order of prece-
       dence, with the latter overriding the former) in the probe-specific
       variable `secret', in an external file or in the target-specific vari-
       able `secret'.  This external file is located by the probe-specific
       variable `secretfile', and it should contain whitespace-separated pairs
       of the form `<host> <secret>'. Comments and blank lines are OK.

       The default TacacsPlus authentication type is ASCII.  PAP and CHAP are
       also available.  See the Authen::TacacsPlus documentation for more
       information;

       The probe tries to be nice to the server and does not send authentica-
       tion requests more frequently than once every X seconds, where X is the
       value of the target-specific "min_interval" variable (1 by default).

VVAARRIIAABBLLEESS
       Supported probe-specific variables:

       forks
           Run this many concurrent processes at maximum

           Example value: 5

           Default value: 5

       offset
           If you run many probes concurrently you may want to prevent them
           from hitting your network all at the same time. Using the probe-
           specific offset parameter you can change the point in time when
           each probe will be run. Offset is specified in % of total interval,
           or alternatively as 'random', and the offset from the 'General'
           section is used if nothing is specified here. Note that this does
           NOT influence the rrds itself, it is just a matter of when data
           acqusition is initiated.  (This variable is only applicable if the
           variable 'concurrentprobes' is set in the 'General' section.)

           Example value: 50%

       passwordfile
           Location of the file containing usernames and passwords.

           Example value: /some/place/secret

       secretfile
           A file containing the TacacsPlus shared secrets for the targets. It
           should contain whitespace-separated pairs of the form `<host>
           <secret>'. Comments and blank lines are OK.

           Example value: /another/place/secret

       step
           Duration of the base interval that this probe should use, if dif-
           ferent from the one specified in the 'Database' section. Note that
           the step in the RRD files is fixed when they are originally gener-
           ated, and if you change the step parameter afterwards, you'll have
           to delete the old RRD files or somehow convert them. (This variable
           is only applicable if the variable 'concurrentprobes' is set in the
           'General' section.)

           Example value: 300

       Supported target-specific variables:

       authtype
           The TacacsPlus Authentication type:ASCII(default), CHAP, PAP

           Example value: CHAP

           Default value: ASCII

       mininterval
           The minimum interval between each authentication request sent, in
           (possibly fractional) seconds.

           Default value: 1

       password
           The password for the user, if not present in the password file.

           Example value: test-password

       pings
           How many pings should be sent to each target, if different from the
           global value specified in the Database section. Note that the num-
           ber of pings in the RRD files is fixed when they are originally
           generated, and if you change this parameter afterwards, you'll have
           to delete the old RRD files or somehow convert them.

           Example value: 5

       port
           The TacacsPlus port to be used

           Example value: 49

           Default value: 49

       secret
           The TacacsPlus shared secret for the target, if not present in the
           secrets file.

           Example value: test-secret

       timeout
           Timeout in seconds for the TacacsPlus queries.

           Default value: 5

       username
           The username to be tested.

           Example value: test-user

           This setting is mandatory.
