       Smokeping::probes::basevars - Another Base Class for implementing
       SmokePing Probes

OOVVEERRVVIIEEWW
       Like Smokeping::probes::base, but supports host-specific variables for
       the probe.

        probe = basevars # if this should be the default probe

       Provides the method `targets' that returns a list of hashes.  The
       hashes contain the entries:

       addr
           The address of the target.

       vars
           A hash containing variables defined in the corresponding config
           section.

       tree
           The unique index that `probe::base' uses for targets.

           There's also the method 'vars' that returns the abovementioned hash
           corresponding to the 'tree' index parameter.

       Supported probe-specific variables:

       offset
           If you run many probes concurrently you may want to prevent them
           from hitting your network all at the same time. Using the probe-
           specific offset parameter you can change the point in time when
           each probe will be run. Offset is specified in % of total interval,
           or alternatively as 'random', and the offset from the 'General'
           section is used if nothing is specified here. Note that this does
           NOT influence the rrds itself, it is just a matter of when data
           acqusition is initiated.  (This variable is only applicable if the
           variable 'concurrentprobes' is set in the 'General' section.)

           Example value: 50%

       pings
           How many pings should be sent to each target, if different from the
           global value specified in the Database section. Note that the num-
           ber of pings in the RRD files is fixed when they are originally
           generated, and if you change this parameter afterwards, you'll have
           to delete the old RRD files or somehow convert them.

           Example value: 20

       step
           Duration of the base interval that this probe should use, if dif-
           ferent from the one specified in the 'Database' section. Note that
           the step in the RRD files is fixed when they are originally gener-
           ated, and if you change the step parameter afterwards, you'll have
           to delete the old RRD files or somehow convert them. (This variable
           is only applicable if the variable 'concurrentprobes' is set in the
           'General' section.)

           Example value: 300

       Uses `Smokeping::probes::base' internals too much to be a derived
       class, but I didn't want to touch the base class directly.
