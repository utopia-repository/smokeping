       Smokeping::Examples - A module for generating the smokeping_examples
       document

OOVVEERRVVIIEEWW
       This module generates smokeping_examples and the example configuration
       files distributed with Smokeping. It is supposed to be invoked from the
       smokeping distribution top directory, as it will need the "etc/con-
       fig.dist" template configuration file and will create files in the
       directories "doc" and "doc/examples".

DDEESSCCRRIIPPTTIIOONN
       The entry point to the module is the "make" subroutine. It takes one
       optional parameter, "check", that makes the module run a syntax check
       for all the created example configuration files.

BBUUGGSS
       This module uses more or less internal functions from Smokeping.pm.
       It's a separate module only because the latter is much too big already.

       It should be possible to include POD markup in the configuration expla-
       nations and have this module filter them away for the config files.

       It might be nice for the probe module authors to be able to provide an
       example configuration as part of the probe module instead of having to
       modify Smokeping::Examples too.
