       This module offers three functions, "info2create", "com-
       pare" and "tuneds". The first can be used to recreate the
       arguments that an RRD file was created with. The second
       checks if an RRD file was created with the given argu-
       ments. The thirds tunes the DS parameters according to the
       supplied create string.

       The function "info2create" must be called with one argu-
       ment: the path to the interesting RRD file. It will return
       an array reference of the argument list that can be fed to
       "RRDs::create".  Note that this list will never contain
       the "start" parameter, but it wwiillll contain the "step"
       parameter.

       The function "compare" must be called with two arguments:
       the path to the interesting RRD file, and a reference to
       an argument list that could be fed to "RRDs::create". The
       function will then simply compare the result of "info2cre-
       ate" with this argument list.  It will return "undef" if
       the arguments matched, and a string indicating the differ-
       ence if a discrepancy was found. Note that if there is a
       "start" parameter in the argument list, "compare" disre-
       gards it. If "step" isn't specified, "compare" will use
       the "rrdtool" default of 300 seconds. "compare" ignores
       non-matching DS parameters since "tuneds" will fix them.

       "tuneds" talks on stderr about the parameters it fixes.

       This module is not particularly specific to Smokeping, it
       is just distributed with it.

       Probably.
