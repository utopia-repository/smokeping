       Smokeping::matchers::Avgratio - detect changes in average median
       latency

OOVVEERRVVIIEEWW
       The Avgratio matcher establishes a historic average median latency over
       several measurement rounds. It compares this average, against a second
       average latency value again build over several rounds of measurement.

       Call the matcher with the following sequence:

        type = matcher
        pattern =  Avgratio(historic=>a,current=>b,comparator=>o,percentage=>p)

       historic
           The number of median values to use for building the 'historic'
           average.

       current
           The number of median values to use for building the 'current' aver-
           age.

       comparator
           Which comparison operator should be used to compare current/his-
           toric with percentage.

       percentage
           Right hand side of the comparison.

         old <--- historic ---><--- current ---> now

       Take build the average median latency over 10 samples, use this to
       divide the current average latency built over 2 samples and check if it
       is bigger than 150%.

        Avgratio(historic=>10,current=>2,comparator=>'>',percentage=>150);

        avg(current)/avg(historic) > 150/100

       This means the matcher will activate when the current latency average
       is more than 1.5 times the historic latency average established over
       the last 10 rounds of measurement.
