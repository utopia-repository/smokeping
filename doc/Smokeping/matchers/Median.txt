       Smokeping::matchers::Median - Find persistant changes in latency

OOVVEERRVVIIEEWW
       The idea behind this matcher is to find sustained changes in latency.

       The median matcher takes a number of past median latencies. It splits
       the latencies into two groups (old and new) and again finds the median
       for each groups. If the difference between the two medians is bigger
       than a certain value, it will give a match.

DDEESSCCRRIIPPTTIIOONN
       Call the matcher with the following sequence:

        type = matcher
        pattern =  Median(old=>x,new=>y,diff=>z)

       This will create a matcher which consumes x+y latency-datapoints,
       builds the two medians and the matches if the difference between the
       median latency is larger than z seconds.
