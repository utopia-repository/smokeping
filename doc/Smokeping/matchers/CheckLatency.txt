       Smokeping::matchers::CheckLatency - Edge triggered alert to check
       latency is under a value for x number of samples

       Call the matcher with the following sequence:

        type = matcher
        edgetrigger = yes
        pattern =  CheckLatency(l=>latency to check against,x=>num samples required for a match)

       This will create a matcher which checks for "l" latency or greater over
       "x" samples before raising, and will hold the alert until "x" samples
       under "l" before clearing
