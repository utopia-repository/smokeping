       Smokeping::matchers::Medratio - detect changes in the latency median

OOVVEERRVVIIEEWW
       The Medratio matcher establishes a historic median latency over several
       measurement rounds. It compares this median, against a second median
       latency value again build over several rounds of measurement.

       By looking at the median value this matcher is largly imune against
       spikes and will only react to long term developments.

       Call the matcher with the following sequence:

        type = matcher
        pattern =  Medratio(historic=>a,current=>b,comparator=>o,percentage=>p)

       historic
           The number of values to use for building the 'historic' median.

       current
           The number of values to use for building the 'current' median.

       comparator
           Which comparison operator should be used to compare current/his-
           toric with percentage.

       percentage
           Right hand side of the comparison.

         old <--- historic ---><--- current ---> now

       Take  the 12 last median values. Build the median out of the first 10
       and the median from the other 2 values. Divide the results and decide
       if it is bigger than 150 percent.

        Medratio(historic=>10,current=>2,comparator=>'>',percentage=>150);

        med(current)/med(historic) > 150/100

       This means the matcher will activate when the current latency median is
       more than 1.5 times the historic latency median established over the
       last 10 rounds of measurement.
