       Smokeping::matchers::base - Base Class for implementing SmokePing
       Matchers

OOVVEERRVVIIEEWW
       This is the base class for writing SmokePing matchers. Every matcher
       must inherit from the base class and provide it's own methods for the
       'business' logic.

       Note that the actual matchers must have at least one capital letter in
       their name, to differentiate them from the base class(es).

       Every matcher must provide the following methods:

       nneeww

       The new method expects hash elements as an argument eg
       new({x=>'\d+',y=>'\d+'},x=>1,y=>2). The first part is a syntax rule for
       the arguments it should expect and the second part are the arguments
       itself. The first part will be supplied by the child class as it calls
       the parent method.

       LLeennggtthh

       The Length method returns the number of values the matcher will expect
       from SmokePing. This method must be overridden by the children of the
       base class.

       DDeesscc

       Simply return the description of the function. This method must be
       overwritten by a children of the base class.

       TTeesstt

       Run the matcher and return true or false. The Test method is called
       with a hash containing two arrays giving it access to both rtt and loss
       values.

         my $data=shift;
         my @rtt = @{$data->{rtt}};
         my @loss = @{$data->{loss}};

       The arrays are ordered from old to new.

         @rdd[old..new]

       There may be more than the expected number of elements in this array.
       Address them with $x[-1] to $x[-max].

       There's also a key called 'prevmatch' in the hash. It contains the
       value returned by the previous call of the 'Test' method. This allows
       for somewhat more intelligent alerting due to state awareness.

         my $prevmatch = $data->{prevmatch};
