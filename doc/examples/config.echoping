# This example shows most of the echoping-derived probes in action.

+ FPing
binary = /usr/bin/fping

# these expect to find echoping in /usr/bin
# if not, you'll have to specify the location separately for each probe
# + EchoPing         # uses TCP or UDP echo (port 7)
# + EchoPingDiscard  # uses TCP or UDP discard (port 9)
# + EchoPingChargen  # uses TCP chargen (port 19)
+ EchoPingSmtp       # SMTP (25/tcp) for mail servers
+ EchoPingHttps      # HTTPS (443/tcp) for web servers
+ EchoPingHttp       # HTTP (80/tcp) for web servers and caches
+ EchoPingIcp        # ICP (3130/udp) for caches

*** Targets ***

# All the servers are pinged both with ICMP (the FPing probe)
# and their respective echoping probe. The proxy server, www-cache,
# is probed with both HTTP requests and ICP requests for the same
# URL.
