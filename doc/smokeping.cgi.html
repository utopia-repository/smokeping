<P>smokeping.cgi - SmokePing webfrontend</P>
<P>
<HR>
<H1><A NAME="overview">OVERVIEW</A></H1>
<P>This script acts as a 'website' for your SmokePing monitoring operation. It
presents the targets you are looking at in a tree structure and draws graphs
as they are required by people looking at the pages.</P>
<P>
<HR>
<H1><A NAME="description">DESCRIPTION</A></H1>
<P>To get <STRONG>smokeping.cgi</STRONG> going, you need a webserver which allows you to run
cgi scripts. The system must be setup so that the <STRONG>smokeping.cgi</STRONG> is
allowed to write to the image caching area as defined in the config file.</P>
<P>This script runs with normal perl. <STRONG>BUT</STRONG> it will appear to be very slow,
because it does a lot of things when starting up. So if the script has to be
started a fresh on every click, this is both slow and a tough thing for your
webserver. I therefore strongly recomment using SpeedyCGI.</P>
<P>Please refer to the installation document for detailed setup instructions.</P>
<P>
<HR>
<H1><A NAME="setup">SETUP</A></H1>
<P>When installing SmokePing, this file has to be adjusted to fit your
local system. Three paths have to be entered.</P>
<PRE>
 use lib qw(/usr/pack/rrdtool-1.0.33-to/lib/perl);</PRE>
<P>One pointing to your <STRONG>rrdtool</STRONG> installation</P>
<PRE>
 use lib qw(/home/oetiker/public_html/smokeping/lib);</PRE>
<P>One pointing to the place where you have installed the SmokePing libraries</P>
<PRE>
 use Smokeping;</PRE>
<PRE>
 Smokeping::cgi(&quot;/home/oetiker/.smokeping/config&quot;);</PRE>
<P>The third path is the argument to the Smokeping::main command. It points to
the SmokePing configuration file.</P>
