       SmokePing does not stand alone. It relies on various other tools and
       services being present. Apart from a Unix OS and a working Perl
       installation you need the following components:

       RRDtool 1.2.x or later
           Smokeping uses RRDtool for logging and graphing. If your linux
           distro provides an rrdtool  package with perl support, use this. If
           you want to get the latest and greatest version, compile your own:
           <http://oss.oetiker.ch/rrdtool/>

       FPing (optional)
           The official site <http://fping.sourceforge.net/> seems to be a bit
           unmaintained. You might want to grab an updated version of fping
           from <http://oss.oetiker.ch/smokeping/pub/>.

           Note that fping must be installed setuid root. It seems that older
           versions of fping report round trip times in 0.1 milliseconds
           instead of 1 milliseconds as advertised ... SmokePing tries to
           figure this out. It tells you when it starts ... let me know if it
           gets it wrong.

       EchoPing  (Optional)
           <http://echoping.sourceforge.net/>

           You need this to run the EchoPing probes

       Curl (Optional)
           <http://curl.haxx.se/>

           You need this for the Curl probe.

       dig (Optional)
           <http://www.isc.org/sw/bind/>

           You need this for the DNS probe.

       SSH (Optional)
           <http://www.openssh.org/>

           You need this for the SSH probe.

       Webserver
           <http://httpd.apache.org/>

           Well I won't get much into this. The important thing is, to have a
           webserver which allows you to run CGI and preferably FastCGI
           scripts. If you are using Apache I strongly recommend using the
           _s_u_e_x_e_c system for running CGI scripts as a particular user.

           See <http://httpd.apache.org/mod_fcgid/mod/mod_fcgid.html> and
           <http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.2/mod/mod_suexec.html> for more
           information on this.

       Perl 5.8.8 or later.
           If you still have an older version, maybe have a look at perlbrew.

       Various Perl modules (Many are optional)
           The modules are all available from <http://www.cpan.org> and you
           may be able to get them as packages from your distro's repository.
           There is also a script provided in the setup folder to install the
           missing bits.  You will be instructed later on how to use the
           script.

           FCGI
               The module for supporting FastCGI operation.

           CGI, CGI::Fast
               Perl CGI/FastCGI support. Might already be installed localy.

           Config::Grammar
               The configuration file parser used in smokeping

           LWP The master/slave functionality introduced a dependency on
               LWP::UserAgent from the libwww-perl (also known as LWP)
               library.  The module is required even if the master/slave mode
               is not enabled.

           Socket6 (optional)
               The Socket6 module enables smokeping to check hostnames that
               only resolve to an IPv6 address. If you probe such hosts using
               ie. the FPing6 probe and get warnings that those hosts don't
               resolve to an IP address, you need to install it.

           Net::Telnet (optional)
               You need this for the TelnetIOSPing probe.

           Net::OpenSSH (optional)
               You need this for the OpenSSHJunOSPing probe.

           Net::DNS (optional)
               You need this for the AnotherDNS probe.

           Net::LDAP (optional)
               You need this for the LDAP probe.

           IO::Socket::SSL (optional)
               You need this if you want the LDAP probe to be able to use the
               'starttls' command.

           Authen::Radius (optional)
               You need this for the Radius probe.

       Once the tools listed above are in place, you can start setting up
       SmokePing itself. Unpack the tar archive and run the included configure
       script:

        ./configure --prefix=/opt/smokeping

       Configure will verify that all the required perl modules are available.
       If some are missing it will tell you to run the module build script.
       Just follow the instructions on screen and then run configure again.
       Once it completes, you can run

        make install

       to finish your setup.

       Use the _e_t_c_/_c_o_n_f_i_g_._d_i_s_t file as a template to create your own smokeping
       configuration file.  See smokeping_config for details.

       Installing the webinterface
           Copy the content of the _P_R_E_F_I_X_/_h_t_d_o_c_s directory to the place where
           your webserver expects its data. Maybe to _/_v_a_r_/_w_w_w_/_s_m_o_k_e_p_i_n_g.

           Edit the _s_m_o_k_e_p_i_n_g_._f_c_g_i script to point to your smokeping_cgi
           script.

           If you have no FastCGI support in your webserver, you may want to
           use the _s_m_o_k_e_p_i_n_g_._c_g_i script.

       _e_t_c_/_b_a_s_e_p_a_g_e_._h_t_m_l
           Edit the html template to your likings. Please do not remove the
           link to the SmokePing counter and my name from the template.  The
           content of the template will be renderd by smokeping.cgi.  This
           means that all embedded links must be relative to smokeping.cgi.

       _e_t_c_/_s_m_o_k_e_m_a_i_l
           If you are going to use the DDYYNNAAMMIICC IP support, customize the
           contents of this file.

       With all the scaffolding in place, you can now launch the smokeping
       daemon and have it gather data for you. First you may want to run it in
       debug mode to see what it is doing

        ./bin/smokeping --config=/opt/smokeping/etc/config --debug

       once all is well, start it up as a daemon. I would recomend you enable
       the logfile option so that you can see if it runs into trouble.

        ./bin/smokeping --config=/opt/smokeping/etc/config --logfile=smoke.log

       Once the system works, you may want to put a SmokePing startup script
       into your _/_e_t_c_/_i_n_i_t_._d tree. Check out smokeping for further
       information.

       You can now open the smokeping.cgi webpage to look at your data.

       See the smokeping_cgi documentation on how to setup the smokeping web
       interface.
