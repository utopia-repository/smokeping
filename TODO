* UPTIME
  - define update via snmp pointer per device
  - possibility to call an external script
    -> generic uptime plugin?

* ATTENTION
  allow to define a thereshold rule by looking at
  two average medians and take action when threshold triped

* ALIASES
  allow to have atarget which points to a different target
  only targets with host are considered

* ALERTS

* REMOTE EXECUTION
  generic remote probe
  - a possibility for basefork-derived probes to reuse the same
    SSH connection with shell for() loops for all the pings to a given
    target

* GENERIC EXEC PROBE
  - almost every probe has a different way of calling system(), exec()
    or similar. This should be in an inheritable module.
  - the module should also support extra commandline arguments 

* RRD 
  configurable RRD parameters per target?
